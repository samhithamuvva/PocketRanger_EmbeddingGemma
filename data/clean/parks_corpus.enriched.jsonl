The Army was well-suited for the work. Troops patrolled the park’s backcountry to ensure the land was protected from illegal grazing, poaching, and logging. Each summer, over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. In 1899, 1903, and 1904, African-American buffalo soldiers also served in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>Yosemite encompasses vast areas of rugged, roadless terrain. To access such remote places for patrolling, Army officers trained in engineering at West Point supervised the construction of vital infrastructure such as roads, trails, and buildings. These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite’s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent’s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground. Named after Captain Abram Epperson Wood, the first Army officer to serve as Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park, Camp A.E. Wood was the summer home for U.S. Army troops from 1891 through 1905. In 1906, the State of California returned Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the federal government to be managed as part of Yosemite National Park, and the headquarters moved to Yosemite Valley.

During the winter, Anderson lived in this modest cabin, which was originally located in Big Meadow (now Foresta).</p> <p>Anderson applied his skills as a blacksmith and trail builder to open new pathways for sharing the beauties of Yosemite. His most daunting challenge was to find a way to the “perfectly inaccessible” summit of Half Dome, and through persistence, innovation, and guts, Anderson became the first known person known to have accomplished that feat. On that final steep slab of Half Dome, Anderson drilled holes and hammered in iron bolts of his own making, precariously standing on each bolt while painstakingly driving in the next. Shortly after his first ascent of Half Dome, Anderson began guiding others to the top.</p> <p>Besides creating this adventurous and popular hiking route up Half Dome, Anderson also built several other famous trails in Yosemite, including sections of the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Fall.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/anderson-cabin.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

From this summer home, Jorgensen produced paintings of his famous surroundings. For twenty years, he lived among the towering cliffs and waterfalls with his wife and fellow artist Angela.</p> <p>Chris Jorgensen often worked with watercolors, allowing for quick, spontaneous paintings to be completed in the field, rather than in the studio.

This debris slowly filled the shallow lake. A succession of bogs and marshes thrived before the meadows eventually appeared. In this warm interglacial phase, meadows were comprised of sedges, grasses, and many other small plants that depend upon a seasonally high water table and periodic flooding. Oaks, pines, and cedars grew around the drier edges.</p> <p>Look across the Valley for a view of Cook's Meadow. A myriad of meadow vegetation supports a large population of gophers, ground squirrels, mice, birds, and bats. Some larger animals living here are coyote, deer, bear, bobcat, and gray fox.

The rock's story begins about 100 million years ago with granitic magma deep within the earth. This molten material was formed from older continental rock, as it was over-ridden by the westward-moving North American Plate. About 35 million years ago, dramatic uplift began that eventually raised the Sierra Nevada to its current height. Within the last several million years, fluctuations in temperature produced periods of glaciation over much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p> <p>In mountain areas, rivers of ice, sometimes thousands of feet thick, flowed down canyons and stream courses. In Yosemite Valley, where the granites contained vertical cracks and joints, the moving ice masses tore away the fractured rock and moved it down the Merced River canyon. The ice in this Valley was once over 5,000 feet deep and covered everything you can see except the top 800 feet of Half Dome and the top of Eagle Peak just west of Yosemite Falls. Approximately 14,000 years ago, a warming trend began. The receding ice left behind a dam of rock and gravel across the western end of the Valley.

Here, the 3,000-foot-high cliffs trap warm air in the summer and funnel cold air down Merced and Tenaya canyons in the winter. The cliffs also shade half of the Valley because of the low-angled winter sun.</p> <p>The Sierra Nevada enjoys a \"Mediterranean\" climate, which means relatively dry summers and wet winters. As snow melts in late spring, the flow rate of Yosemite Falls (and noise level) may be 20 times greater than it is in autumn. In winter, spray from Upper Yosemite Fall freezes and forms great sheets of ice against the cliff wall. During warm days, large panes of ice come loose and crash to the base. Over several weeks, water continues to freeze and builds a spectacular ice cone much higher than the tallest trees surrounding you.</p> <p>Yosemite Valley's weather generates seasonal change in its meadows. During winter, meadow grasses and sedges mat down beneath several feet of snow. In spring, new shoots emerge quickly and within a month the fresh, green meadow plants are already hiding the brown remnants of the previous year. Many people expect to see abundant spring wildflowers, but the densely growing sedges in these wet meadows inhibit showy displays.

Within three years, the first hotel was established, and within ten years, there were four more. Look toward Lower Yosemite Fall and notice the swath in the trees. Early hotel owners cleared this section of forest so guests could easily see Lower Yosemite Fall. Most of the meadows were fenced, plowed, grazed, and sown to grass for hay. Over 1,000 apple trees were planted and still exist in some areas of the Valley.</p> <p>Prior to 1916, anyone with a little capital could set up a business in Yosemite Valley. From 1858 to the present, eighteen hotels and inns have been built in many parts of the Valley. Other conveniences such as saloons, boathouses, photographic studios, laundries, and livery stables once dotted the landscape. In the early 1900s, less than 10,000 people per year visited this Valley. Most of them complained of dust from wagon wheels and hoofed animals, smells made by the livestock, and landscapes spoiled by farming and grazing. There were telegraph and telephone wires, power poles, and poor sewer systems. At that time, an awareness was growing that special places should be spared from these types of intrusions.</p> <p>The Organic Act of 1916 established the National Park Service and set its purpose \"...to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"</p> <p>Past generations had the foresight to protect this land and now our generation must improve upon and continue that legacy.</p> <p>As you walk to the next stop, try to imagine what sorts of threats--both natural and human-caused--people feared could harm the Valley.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/cooks-meadow-tour-change-yosemite-opens-to-the-world-stop-4.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

For example, early visitors to Yosemite misunderstood the essential role of fire, viewing it as merely destructive and dangerous and responding to it with alarm and fear. We now understand that suppressing natural lightning-caused fires can ultimately harm the plants and animals that have adapted to it. The place in which you now stand exemplifies the ill effects of past fire suppression policies.</p> <p>Look at the surrounding old oak trees that are shadowed by taller, neighboring pines and cedars. Weakened from competition for sunlight, the oaks are vulnerable to heart rot, root rot, and predatory insects. Prior to years of fire suppression, natural fires once cycled through portions of the Valley every 15 to 20 years. These fires created conditions in which the oaks would thrive.</p> <p>Modern scientific research continues to determine how best to simulate natural fire conditions. At present, fire management teams oversee a prescribed fire program that returns fire to each meadow every 5 to 8 years. Fire contributes valuable nutrients to the soil for meadow grasses and sedges and also kills young pine saplings. In the last 150 years, the total meadow area in this Valley has dwindled from over 800 acres to fewer than 400 because of the gradual invasions by surrounding pines and cedars.</p> <p>Besides periodic fires, meadow and wetland plants need periodic flooding and the formation of high water tables.

An organized group of miners calling themselves the Mariposa Battalion tried to remove the Ahwahneechees from Yosemite. Many natives fled to the high country through Indian Canyon. You can see Indian Canyon (also called Lehemite) from this location. It is the first deep canyon to the right of Yosemite Falls. Despite this initial displacement, their culture survived.

Shortly after, they built their own house, which included plumbing.</p> <p>To support her growing family, Bridget began selling bread and baked goods from her home while raising eight children. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting Yosemite, Bridget helped meet food service demands by baking up to fifty loaves of bread a day in her small household oven. From her porch, she sold bread and home-cooked meals to Yosemite locals and toursits, each loaf selling for 12½ cents.</p> <p>Around 1898, the Degnans built a larger home and Bridget purchased a large brick commercial dutch oven for a more permanent bakery. She could then bake 400 loaves a day, and began serving full meals on her front porch to locals and park visitors. Her bakery (pictured below) was originally connected to their family home near the chapel in Yosemite Valley and is an important reminder of Yosemite's early visitor services.

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion.

This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event.

Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams with fresh granite. You'll notice that most of the boulders along the trail here are covered with lichen and moss. This tells us that these boulders have been sitting here undisturbed for a very long time. In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872.

Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls.

Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-rockfall-hazards-stop-6.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

However, on January 2, 1997 the Merced was a raging torrent. The 1997 flood is the most damaging in Yosemite's recorded history. In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar.

As you near its base, look at the fires scars that remain. Fire plays a very important role in the growth of a giant sequoia.<br /> <br /> Giant sequoias have a dependency on natural fires for reproduction, which was not understood until the early 1960s. Lightning-caused fires reduce the competition from other evergreens, burn away the leaf litter on the forest floor, and leave a thin layer of nutrient-rich ash over the mineral soil, creating perfect conditions for seedlings to sprout. Look at the forest floor around you. Can you see the soil? Or, do you see leaf litter covering the soil?<br /> <br /> Also, the heat from a fire dries some of the mature trees' green sequoia cones, causing a shower of fresh seeds to fall onto a perfectly-prepared seedbed. When winter comes, snow blankets the Mariposa Grove. As the snowpack melts the following spring, sunlight, moisture, fresh seeds, ash, and mineral soil combine to create a sequoia nursery.<br /> <br /> To reduce the leaf litter and promote giant sequoia reproduction, the National Park Service began igniting \"prescribed burns,\" that are deliberately set and closely monitored by rangers, during spring and fall. When the forest returns to a more natural state, these management fires will most likely be discontinued. Then nature can resume its cycle of lightning-caused fires every five to twenty years.

Thomas “Tom” Hodgdon acquired land for grazing cattle in Aspen Valley, now within Yosemite National Park. In 1879, Tom hired workers to build an access road, and a two-story cabin, on the land. To build the two-story log cabin, he hired a Chinese American cowboy named Ah Hoy and a neighbor named Franklin Babcock. The Hodgdon family, ranchers from the San Joaquin Valley, grazed cattled on their homesteaded land in Aspen Valley each summer.</p> <p>Tom and family ran a ranching business, grazing cattle in nearby meadows. After these meadows became part of Yosemite National Park in 1890, U.S. Army troops enforced park regulations against grazing by dispersing cattle, and the Hodgdons lost grazing privileges. The family didn’t use the cabin for a while, and patrolling soldiers, and even Army horses, sheltered inside occasionally.</p> <p>No longer able to earn a living with livestock in Yosemite, the Hodgdon family adapted to make money from tourism. In 1882, as part of the Great Sierra Wagon Road, the Hodgdons’ access road was improved upon by Chinese workers, and extended to Tioga Pass for silver mining. When the Tioga Road opened to the public, tourist traffic increased through Aspen Valley. The Hodgdon family used their cabin, and created a complex of new buildings, used for tourist lodging.

It was the job of these rangers to protect the natural resources, stop forest fires, and assist visitors. Their duties were made more difficult as automobiles had recently been allowed to enter the park.</p> <p>The ranger patrol cabin was built in 1915 to house rangers at Crane Flat, a busy road junction. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations. Along sections of the Big Oak Flat and Wawona roads, automobiles were only permitted to go east, downgrade, on odd hours and west, upgrade, on even hours. At Crane Flat and others Yosemite locations, rangers needed to live close to backcountry patrol routes and roadside stations where they assisted visitors arriving by automobile. In 1916 the National Park Service was created and the rangers living here became some of the first National Park Service Rangers.</p> <p>Gabriel Sovulewski, a Polish immigrant, embodied the administrative transition from the military to the National Park Service in Yosemite. He first saw Yosemite in 1895 while on a summer deployment to the park with the U.S. Army. In 1902, he left the Army and returned to Yosemite to work as a packer and guide. In 1906, Gabriel was placed in charge of Yosemite National Park, serving as the top park official for thirty years. During that time he directed the construction of trails and buildings such as the Ranger Patrol Cabin. Gabriel Sovulewski remained in Yosemite for the rest of his life, and is buried next to his wife, Rose in the Yosemite Cemetery.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/ranger-patrol-cabin.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

Beyond that, on unpaved areas, they are prohibited. A pit toilet is available where the paved road ends, near the views of Mirror Lake.<br /> <br /> <strong>Caution: </strong>During spring and early summer, when water levels are highest, entering the water can be dangerous. Always remember when approaching moving water to look at the conditions downstream. Waters in this area may appear ankle deep at first, but can quickly become thigh deep, and, all too often, hikers are swept into dangerous whitewater and pinned against rocks. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/swiftwater.htm\">Learn more</a> about past experiences visitors had with swift water in this area of the park.</p> <h2>Accessibility </h2> <p>A one-mile road, from the Mirror Lake shuttle stop, leads to this view of the lake and is easy to walk due to its paved surface.

The trail includes spectacular views of Tueeulala and Wapama Falls.<br /> <br /> The trail to Rancheria Falls continues past Wapama Falls and may be done as either a long day hike (13 miles round trip) or a backpacking trip. Permits are required for all overnight hikes. Visit a wilderness center for more information.</p> <h2>Wapama Falls</h2> <p><strong>Distance: </strong>5 miles (8 km) round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation gain: </strong>507 ft (155 m)<br /> <strong>Time estimate: </strong>2 hours</p> <h2>Rancheria Falls</h2> <p><strong>Distance: </strong>13.4 miles (21.4 km) round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation gain: </strong>1909 ft (581 m)<br /> <strong>Time estimate: </strong>6 to 8 hours</p> <h2>Tips & Hours</h2> <p>Expect substantial mist from Wapama Falls in spring and early summer. By late summer, waterfalls in this area have typically slowed or dried out. Watch for rattlesnakes and poison oak in this area.<br /> <br /> Pets are prohibited on all hiking trails. Swimming and boating are prohibited in Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in order to maintain a clean source of drinking water.<br /> <br /> Unlike other areas of Yosemite, the road to Hetch Hetchy is open from sunrise to sunset only.

Many thought he was crazy to leave behind his landscape architecture work, and his father made sure Frederick knew his displeasure over the move. However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln’s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father’s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father’s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments.

However, the final fourteen-mile leg of the journey from El Portal to Yosemite Valley was still made by stage, and later by autos.</p> <p>Upon arrival at this terminal in Yosemite Valley, passengers could book a stay in a hotel and make transportation arrangements with travel agents, who lived in the building’s back rooms. Despite its rustic design, the office provided modern conveniences. Visitors could make telephone calls or send telegrams to anywhere in the world. By 1914, automobiles were common in Yosemite, and in that year, horse-drawn stage service was discontinued. However, annual visitation to the park in 1915 doubled to 31,000. Consequently, stage operation was renewed but only for one additional year. In 1916, the era of stage travel ended and another began. The National Park Service, a federal agency created to preserve and manage our country's national parks, was established.</p> <p>The reliance on transportation companies for park access diminished greatly when the All-Year Highway (now California Highway 140) opened in 1927, and personal cars soon became the dominant means of transportation in Yosemite.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/yosemite-transportation-office.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

The park’s rich habitats range from thick foothill chaparral to conifer forests to expanses of alpine rock. Animals feel at home in each location.</p> <p><strong>While seeing wildlife in Yosemite can be exciting, remember that it is illegal to approach or feed any wild animal in Yosemite, including birds and squirrels.</strong><br /> <br /> Wildlife can cause injuries and transmit diseases. Human food is unhealthy for wild animals. Animals used to being fed can become dangerous and be killed as a result. Stay at least 150 ft (46 m) from bears and coyotes. Stay at least 25 ft (8 m) from all other wildlife.</p> <h2>What to Do If You See a Bear</h2> <p>You may not see a bear during your visit because bears naturally avoid people. If you do see a bear, what you should do depends on the situation. In any case, always let a ranger know or leave a message at 209/372-0322.

Scare the bear away by yelling aggressively and as loudly as possible until the bear leaves. The bear is intruding on your personal space: act angry and be persistent.

Designated a World Heritage Site and an Important Bird Area, the park harbors diverse avian assemblages and habitats, numerous bird species of special concern, and prized habitat ranging from gently sloping foothill grasslands, through chaparral/oak woodland and giant conifer forests, up to windswept alpine meadows and peaks.</p> <p>The most regularly seen resident birds include Steller's jay, American robin, acorn woodpecker, common raven, and mountain chickadee. In spring, look for the bright red wing patches on the red-winged blackbird (most often seen in wet meadows) or the tropical looking western tanager foraging in the conifers. Near rivers and streams, watch the american dipper dart in and out of rapids and listen for their beautiful melodious song.</p> <p>Some of the more sought-after birds to see in Yosemite include the great gray owl, spotted owl, peregrine falcon, pileated woodpecker, and northern goshawk.</p> <p>In general, quiet forests and meadows away from developed areas (particularly in the mornings) are the best places to see some of the less common birds.

Looking for economic opportunity and accompanied by two Monache/Yokuts Indians, Tharp first visited the Giant Forest in 1858. <br /> <br /> A stockman by trade, Tharp used nearby Log Meadow as a seasonal grazing pasture and lived in this tiny rustic cabin until the creation of Sequoia National Park in 1890. His goal was to raise cattle and sell beef to an expanding local population. <br /> <br /> Tharp adapted this 70-foot hollow sequoia log as the structure for his summer cabin. A fire had burned inside the tree, lining its interior with charcoal. He carved a window and made a shutter with horseshoe hinges. Tharp enclosed the open end of his log home with a shingled building and added a fireplace and chimney made from granite boulders. <br /> <br /> Tharp had limited resources to create this cabin among the trees, but the details really made this place his home.

In the summer, Tharp and two Monache/Yokuts Indians traveled together along the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River, past Moro Rock, and through nearby Log Meadow to a place they called the “big tree forest.” Chief Chappo’s descendants believe that guides accompanied Tharp for his safety along the treacherous, higher-elevation routes and that Tharp must have earned their trust for them to share this valued place. <br /> <br /> Text, right-hand column, second section titled \"New Arrivals\": Early settlers arriving here in the Giant Forest came with a wide array of motivations.

In this system, trees are measured by trunk volume only, not branches, leaves, or roots. <br /> <br /> Tree dimensions change year to year because trees grow, branches fall, and fires can burn and remove a portion of a tree. Until 2003, the Washington Tree in Giant Forest (Sequoia National Park) was the second-largest sequoia.

{"park_code": "seki", "content_type": "places", "title": "General Sherman Tree", "section_heading": "General Sherman Tree", "body_text": "<p>There are taller trees, and wider trees, but the General Sherman Tree contains more wood (volume) in its trunk than any other tree on Earth. Behind the Sherman Tree are the General Grant, President, Lincoln, and Stagg trees. Another measure of tree volume is the total biomass of the tree-trunk, branches, roots, and foliage. If we measure the biomass, the Sherman Tree still ranks at #1, but the General Grant Tree loses second place to the President Tree.<br /> <br /> Rapid growth over a long life accounts for the size of these trees, but they are not as old as once thought. The most recent age estimate of the Sherman Tree is about 2200 years old.<br /> <br /> Sequoia roots are shallow but spread wide. They entangle with the roots of other sequoias, forming a kind of mesh that helps all the trees maintain balance and stability.<br /> <br /> As you walk among sequoias, watch for Douglas squirrels, also called chickarees. They climb into sequoias and chew through the stems of cones. If you come across a tree that seems to drop a cone every few seconds, you know that a Douglas squirrel is cutting cones for dinner. They then eat the green, fleshy covering of the cones; look for chewed-up cones on the ground. They also store cones and dried mushrooms high in pines or sequoias.<br /> <br /> The Congress Trail starts near the Sherman Tree, and provides a tour of some of the most spectacular sequoias of Giant Forest. This easy three-mile loop also connects to other trails that can take you throughout Giant Forest (be sure to take a map).<br /> <br /> The Sherman Tree was once named the Karl Marx Tree by the Kaweah Colony, a utopian group that lived in Three Rivers before Congress created this park. The Kaweah Colony supported itself in part through logging. When the national park was established, their efforts were deemed illegal.

Today, it is still an important place for the descendants of the village, and a site where people of many backgrounds come to rest, play, and explore the natural world.The Hospital Rock area features hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Snow, ice, and water carved the surrounding hillsides and valley floor. In this place, several large granite boulders provided temporary shelter or space for tribal gatherings. The area namesake rock, <i>Pah-din</i> or Hospital Rock, is a massive 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Like the landscape, the river is a life force. It is home to fish and insects, and sustains nearby plant life.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Civilian Conservation Corps</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the Hospital Rock landscape changed dramatically. Assigned to Hospital Rock, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed several landscaping and improvement projects. They also cut a new stone staircase leading to the pictograph, built the Big Pool Trail and tunnel, and built a historic vehicle water station. Many local Native Americans joined the Corps and contributed to its projects nationwide.</p> <h3>Connections between Land and People Exhibit</h3> <h4>Native American groups lived, interacted, and traded goods in this village for generations.

They continue to gather here as land stewards to practice their culture, educate, restore native plants, and for spiritual and special events.</h4> <p>Native Americans have a deep connection with the land. When Hospital Rock was an active village, the people cared for the plants and woodland ecosystem in ways that promoted health and abundance. From this practice, they were able to harvest materials necessary to live and thrive. Even today, these tribal cultural practices remain a way of life.Life here included fishing and gathering foods, cultivating the land, trading, playing games, visiting, andconnecting to one’s spiritual beliefs. The land provided everything needed to survive. People of the village harvested plants to build shelters, weave baskets, and create snares.Fire has always been part of this landscape. People living here depended on it for warmth and cooking. They also used it to clear vegetation to improve visibility and productivity in forests and grasslands.In this area, Native Americans hunted game, such as deer, squirrels, birds, and fished for food. Theyalso gathered plants, acorns, seeds, berries, and roots.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Homeland</h4> <p>“This is an ancient site, a sensitive site.... People took care of each other here. There’s a welcome feeling here...the medicine is strong.”A connection with the land is critical to North Fork Mono Tribal Chairman Ron Goode. “Everything out here is our relations.” Traditional Ecological Knowledge has been passed down for generations by his people, and children today have strong relationships with the land. This traditional knowledge guides their restoration of damaged meadows and waterways in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This work benefits not only tribal lands, but also national forests and parks.</p> <h3>A Village Exhibit</h3> <h4>In this area, the Mono (Monache), the Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal connected with their neighboring tribes to form a vibrant community.

These connections continue today.</h4> <p>Many groups lived, visited, gathered, and practiced traditions here. Historical accounts document more than 500 people occupying this village. Travelers stopped at the village to visit, rest, or trade. Runners and messengers used the extensive trails to deliver news about events such as fires. Tribal leaders are responsible for the safety and welfare of their people, including welcoming outsiders, negotiating with neighboring groups, and maintaining peace.By the 1860s, Native Americans left the Hospital Rock area. New settlers forced many out of the area, while others died from newly introduced diseases.Today, Mono (Monache), Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal live all over the world. Some live on rancherias, reservations, or other Indian lands. Their descendants maintain a strong connection to <i>Pah-din</i> (Hospital Rock) and often participate in park management decisions.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-A True Leader</h4> <p>The descendants of Chief Chappo remember him as a strong leader who was compassionate, honest, and decisive—a peacemaker and a healer. Responsible for the welfare of his people, Chappo lived peacefully at Hospital Rock for generations. In the 1860’s, when new settlers arrived, they brought disease and conflict to the area. Chappo made the difficult decision to leave his homeland to save his people. Today, his descendants share stories about his gifts, and work to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h3>Activity, Past and Present Exhibit</h3> <h4>Signs that <em>Pah-din</em> (Hospital Rock) was once a vibrant village are all around us.

Picture a village with dwellings (called nobi by the Mono people), children playing, women preparing food, and men getting ready for a hunt. This location inspired a way of life and created traditions and practices that continue today.Village women processed acorns into a flour that was a staple food. They made depressions in flat bedrock to create grinding holes, or mortars, and used cylindrical stones as pestles.Redbud shrubs provide strong, flexible shoots that were split or kept whole to weave into baskets. Elderberry shrubs were used for food, cultural uses, medicine, or ceremonial use.Items such as beads and obsidian (volcanic glass) may be found here.

On occasions, healers cared for injured travelers here. The English name “Hospital Rock” was first used in 1873 after a pioneer recovered here from a trapping injury.Spirituality was prominent in the form of reverence for the natural world. The land and its animals were respected. Creation stories were passed down within families.­Like the beat of drums, sounds from clapper sticks are an important part of cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial traditions. Clapper sticks are made from elderberry stalks.Today, families picnic together, share memories, swim in the Kaweah River, and hike in this spot.</p> <h3>Shared Voices Exhibit</h3> <h4>What is your native language? From past to present, many languages have been spoken here, connecting people to this space and to one another.</h4> <p>In the past, California Native American groups lived, met, and gathered here. They spoke a number of languages and dialects to trade goods, share news, and cooperate with others. Today, these languages are still heard throughout the Sierra range and foothills. People can tell a lot about their neighbors based on the way they say “hello.” A person’s language communicates to others who they are, where they come from, and how they live.Historically, California Native Americans each had their own language.

According to Marie, “words matter and learning the language is important to our culture.” Marie is one of the last living speakers of the Wukchumni language. With the help of her family, Marie created a Wukchumni dictionary. Containing thousands of words and examples of their uses, the dictionary documents the living language of her people. As part of a movement to preserve our nation’s Native American languages, Marie’s work documents the art and heritage of the Wukchumni voice.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/hospital-rock-picnic-area-exhibits.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

In the springtime, streams and creeks swell to high levels as snowmelt makes its way down towards the Central Valley. Once the snow has melted, however, water levels drop significantly. By late summer, many water sources dry up completely. Inconsistent snowpack from year to year makes it difficult to predict what resources will be available for the parks' flora and fauna. By tracking water levels over time, park scientists can better understand this unique landscape.<br /> <br /> Are you interested in exploring watersheds in the Foothills? Join a park ranger at any point in the year to collect data as a community scientist. In order to be sensitive to the plants and animals that call these streams home, group sizes are limited to a maximum of 6 participants. Individuals with an interest in a longer-term volunteer commitment are encouraged to reach out.<br /> <br /> Call Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' Education Office at 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov for more information.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/marble-falls-trailhead.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

Before you lies one of the largest groves of giant sequoia trees in the world. From this overlook, you can see the tops of sequoias, the canopy of the Redwood Mountain grove.<br /> <br /> It was here that park scientists began to understand the importance of fire in the ecology of forests. The trunks of large giant sequoias trees are almost always marked by fire scars at ground level, and their lower branches have been burned away. Their living limbs and needles grow hundreds of feet above the forest floor, where they are safe from most flames. Fire is necessary in order for sequoia cones to open and release their seeds. It is also necessary to clear away underbrush and give trees the space and sunlight they need to grow. Scientists and park managers have developed ways to use fire to maintain healthy ecosystems within the parks, including natural (lightning) fires and prescribed burns.<br /> <br /> Redwood Canyon also houses thousands of dogwood trees. In spring and early summer, white blossoms cover their branches. In autumn, their foliage turns red, brown, and yellow. Light filtering through the leaves or blossoms creates an ever-changing atmosphere, so the experience of the canyon shifts with the seasons.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/redwood-mountain-overlook.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

They are the tallest living things on Earth! When they start out, they are just little guys. Redwood cones are less than an inch across, with seeds no bigger than a tomato's. Exactly why the redwoods grow so tall is a mystery. Theories continue to develop, but proof remains elusive.</p> <h3>I've Got All My Sisters with Me: Redwood Roots</h3> <p>Aside from logging, the most frequent cause of death for mature redwoods is windfall, because redwood roots only grow 10 to 13 feet below the ground.

In 1933, recently elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt created several new agencies, including the most successful, the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC). Across the country, this program employed tens of thousands of unemployed and unskilled young men from various backgrounds, including: the Junior Enrollees, (young men ages 18 - 26), Reservation Native Americans, local men with forestry experience, and over 25,000 older war veterans. By 1942, over 2.5 million men had served in the CCC. They planted millions of trees, fought forest fires, constructed trails and campground facilities, among many other things. Much of the CCC's work can still be seen throughout the US National Park system, including at Muir Woods National Monument.</p> <h3>How the CCC Reshaped Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods was designated a national monument in 1908. The public's interest in nature, and the growing availability of private automobiles, increased visitation to Muir Woods National Monument and Mount Tamalpais State Park. San Franciscans came in droves to hike, picnic, and to ride the Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway. The railway was aptly nicknamed the \"Crookedest Railroad in the World\" because of its 281 curves in 8 miles of track. The rapid increase in visitors required better facilities, and quickly.<br /> <br /> In 1933, over 200 CCC men arrived at Mount Tamalpais State Park to work on improvements in the state park, at Muir Woods, and on the land belonging to the estate of William Kent. Through 1937, the CCC worked on many types of projects, such as fire protection and flood control, trail improvements, bridges, comfort stations, picnic facilities, and improved administration buildings.</p> <h3>Armoring Redwood Creek</h3> <p>The largest project that the CCC undertook at Muir Woods was providing erosion control on Redwood Creek. Redwood Creek meanders through Muir Woods' majestic redwood forest for 1.4 miles (2.3 km) and is prone to flooding, which damages and erodes the surrounding trees and trails. After extensive damage in 1925, William Kent advocated for use of creek \"revetments\" to armor the banks and prevent future flood damage.<br /> <br /> Revetments are structures made of", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/civilian-conservation-corp-at-muir-woods.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

After extensive damage in 1925, William Kent advocated for use of creek \"revetments\" to armor the banks and prevent future flood damage.<br /> <br /> Revetments are structures made of rocks, stones or concrete, called \"riprap,\" that are installed along the stream banks to control the flow of the water and reduce erosion. They were constructed in places susceptible to erosion during storms. More recently, we've learned that using riprap to turn a stream into a straight channel makes the water flow faster, which makes erosion worse at some places. Streams need space to move and change over time. Fish need bends, pools, rocky areas, tree roots, and logs where they can shelter and feed.<br /> <br /> When you visit Muir Woods today, you can still see some of the CCC's riprap along the banks of Redwood Creek. However, the park is removing some sections of riprap and letting the creek return to its natural flow at places where the local endangered population of Coho salmon need it most.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/civilian-conservation-corp-at-muir-woods.htm", "source": "api", "last_updated": ""}

Redwoods are only able to grow as a result of their unique biotic community. A healthy redwood forest usually includes massive Douglas firs, tanoaks, madrones and other trees. On the forest floor, among ferns and leafy redwood sorrel, mosses and mushrooms help to regenerate the soil. And of course, the redwoods themselves eventually fall to the forest floor where they decompose and return nutrients to the soil.<br /> <br /> Many different shrubs populate the understory of old-growth redwood forests, including numerous berry bushes. Some examples include: huckleberry, blackberry and thimbleberry, which act as seasonal food sources for raccoons and other forest inhabitants.<br /> <br /> When left to their own devices, redwood forests are natural recyclers. The 35 inch average yearly rainfall provides the soil with some nutrients, but trees must rely on each other, living and dead, to receive all they need to be healthy.
