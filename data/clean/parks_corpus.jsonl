Following the precedent set in Yellowstone, our country's first national park, the U.S. Army Cavalry also patrolled General Grant National Park (now known as Kings Canyon National Park) and Yosemite National Park. Each summer over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both parks. <p>Starting in 1891, U.S. Army soldiers were among the first guardians of the recently established Yosemite National Park, protecting the park for twenty-three years before the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. The Army was well-suited for the work. Troops patrolled the park’s backcountry to ensure the land was protected from illegal grazing, poaching, and logging. Each summer, over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. In 1899, 1903, and 1904, African-American buffalo soldiers also served in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>Yosemite encompasses vast areas of rugged, roadless terrain. To access such remote places for patrolling, Army officers trained in engineering at West Point supervised the construction of vital infrastructure such as roads, trails, and buildings. These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite’s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent’s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground. Named after Captain Abram Epperson Wood, the first Army officer to serve as Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park, Camp A.E. Wood was the summer home for U.S. Army troops from 1891 through 1905. In 1906, the State of California returned Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the federal government to be managed as part of Yosemite National Park, and the headquarters moved to Yosemite Valley. Later this building was moved to the Yosemite History Center.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/acting-superintendents-office.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

George Anderson, a miner and blacksmith, worked as a guide in the late 1800s, and escorted visitors on expeditions in Yosemite. In 1875, he was the first person to climb Half Dome. He spent his winters in this building at Big Meadow (now called Foresta), and his summers in Yosemite Valley. <p><i>“Half Dome was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of all the prominent points about Yosemite which has never been and will never be trodden by human foot.” </i>Josiah Whitney, California State Geologist, 1869</p> <p>George Anderson, a Scottish immigrant, came to Yosemite around 1868, working a variety of jobs to make ends meet in Yosemite Valley during the warm summer months. During the winter, Anderson lived in this modest cabin, which was originally located in Big Meadow (now Foresta).</p> <p>Anderson applied his skills as a blacksmith and trail builder to open new pathways for sharing the beauties of Yosemite. His most daunting challenge was to find a way to the “perfectly inaccessible” summit of Half Dome, and through persistence, innovation, and guts, Anderson became the first known person known to have accomplished that feat. On that final steep slab of Half Dome, Anderson drilled holes and hammered in iron bolts of his own making, precariously standing on each bolt while painstakingly driving in the next. Shortly after his first ascent of Half Dome, Anderson began guiding others to the top.</p> <p>Besides creating this adventurous and popular hiking route up Half Dome, Anderson also built several other famous trails in Yosemite, including sections of the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Fall.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/anderson-cabin.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Artists were drawn to Yosemite, where they found inspiration in the magnificent scenery. Paintings, drawings, sketches, and photographs publicized and popularized Yosemite. Consequently, many people chose to travel the arduous route to Yosemite and experience the beauty firsthand. Thus, artists played a key role in increased awareness, tourism, and protection. <p>Like many artists, Norwegian immigrant Chris Jorgensen fell in love with Yosemite’s grandeur, and challenged himself to capture it on canvas. After visiting Yosemite for the first time in 1898, Jorgensen was granted permission to build a home and a studio on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley (near today's Sentinel Bridge). From this summer home, Jorgensen produced paintings of his famous surroundings. For twenty years, he lived among the towering cliffs and waterfalls with his wife and fellow artist Angela.</p> <p>Chris Jorgensen often worked with watercolors, allowing for quick, spontaneous paintings to be completed in the field, rather than in the studio. He loved plein air painting, or painting outdoors. Beyond providing shade, the umbrella he holds in the image below helped with color perception in the harsh sunlight.</p> <p>The bungalow in the Yosemite History Center, part of Jorgensen's Yosemite property, represents an era when artists were some of the best advocates for the preservation of wild places. Yosemite’s landscapes inspired artists to create, and as they shared their art with those unable to experience nature’s beauty first-hand, their creations inspired others to preserve Yosemite as a public park.</p> <p>Even today, Yosemite stirs visitors to connect creatively with the landscape. Photos, paintings, and written accounts of Yosemite are now more popular, and more shareable, than ever.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/artist-cabin-chris-jorgensen-studio.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

The ice in this Valley was once over 5,000 feet deep and covered everything you can see except the top 800 feet of Half Dome and the top of Eagle Peak just west of Yosemite Falls. Approximately 14,000 years ago, a warming trend began. The receding ice left behind a dam of rock and gravel across the western end of the Valley. As the glacier continued to melt away, a shallow lake formed. Imagine swimming to the next stop where you will discover what happened to that ancient lake.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/cooks-meadow-tour-change-the-pace-of-glaciers-stop-1.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

This bakery was originally connected to the Deg <p>Irish immigrants Bridget and John Degnan, along with their infant son Laurence, moved to Yosemite Valley in the mid-1880s. Mountain living proved tough at first. The family first lived in an abandoned barn and had to carry household water from a nearby stream in a five-gallon oil can. Shortly after, they built their own house, which included plumbing.</p> <p>To support her growing family, Bridget began selling bread and baked goods from her home while raising eight children. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting Yosemite, Bridget helped meet food service demands by baking up to fifty loaves of bread a day in her small household oven. From her porch, she sold bread and home-cooked meals to Yosemite locals and toursits, each loaf selling for 12½ cents.</p> <p>Around 1898, the Degnans built a larger home and Bridget purchased a large brick commercial dutch oven for a more permanent bakery. She could then bake 400 loaves a day, and began serving full meals on her front porch to locals and park visitors. Her bakery (pictured below) was originally connected to their family home near the chapel in Yosemite Valley and is an important reminder of Yosemite's early visitor services. Bridget's legacy continued when her children opened an even bigger bakery in 1958, still open today as Degnan's Kitchen in Yosemite Village.

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming. <p>Looking east toward the head of Yosemite Valley, you can see Half Dome, a massive rock formation with a rounded summit and a sheer face that looks like it's been cut in half. Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion. On the sheer face of Half Dome, exfoliation causes rockfalls that occur every few years.<br /> <br /> Please follow the path to your left toward the Merced River to find the next stop.

This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event. Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-john-muir-s-rockfall-experience-stop-7.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872.

Together these waterfalls plunge a total of 2,425 feet, or about 740 meters, making Yosemite Falls one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls. What caused the creek to shift position? We can't see it from here, but behind Yosemite Falls there is a moraine left behind by one of those ancient glaciers. The moraine diverted the Yosemite Creek from its path down the steep gully and forced it directly off the cliff. This unique geological accident created one of the tallest waterfalls in the world and one of the most iconic features in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop make some observations about the ground surface that surrounds the trail.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-origin-of-yosemite-falls-stop-2.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Some of that material makes up the sediment particles in the riverbed before you slowly drifting along in the current and sometimes sweeping away in floods. Take a moment to reflect on the natural processes that continue to shape the awe-inspiring landscape around you. Thanks for joining me today. I hope you have enjoyed learning about the living geology of Yosemite National Park.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-reflections-stop-8.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Some of the talus boulders can be quite large. These boulders were once a part of the cliff face and broke loose in events called rockfalls in which boulders fall, bounce and roll down the cliffs and talus piles. The gigantic boulder in front of you now is from a rockfall that occurred about 3,000 years ago. This boulder is one of the largest you will see in Yosemite Valley but boulders like this are actually fairly common. All of them represent past rockfalls. Since glaciers retreated from Yosemite Valley, rockfalls became the dominant geological force eroding the cliffs and they still occur today. Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-rockfall-hazards-stop-6.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. <p>On most days, the Merced River flows peacefully beneath Superintendents Bridge. However, on January 2, 1997 the Merced was a raging torrent. The 1997 flood is the most damaging in Yosemite's recorded history. In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar. The combination of heavy rain and melted snow across the entire watershed produces extreme flood events. It is under these conditions that the largest, most damaging floods in Yosemite's history have occurred. As global temperatures warm the snowline in Yosemite is likely to increase in elevation also increasing the likelihood of future floods.<br /> <br /> Our next stop is at a huge boulder behind the Chapel, across Southside Drive. To get there, please use one of the two crosswalks crossing Southside Drive and watch for cars. The trail picks up at the far end of the parking lot next to the Chapel.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-yosemite-underwater-twentieth-century-floods-stop-5.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

As you near its base, look at the fires scars that remain. Fire plays a very important role in the growth of a giant sequoia.<br /> <br /> Giant sequoias have a dependency on natural fires for reproduction, which was not understood until the early 1960s. Lightning-caused fires reduce the competition from other evergreens, burn away the leaf litter on the forest floor, and leave a thin layer of nutrient-rich ash over the mineral soil, creating perfect conditions for seedlings to sprout. Look at the forest floor around you. Can you see the soil? Or, do you see leaf litter covering the soil?<br /> <br /> Also, the heat from a fire dries some of the mature trees' green sequoia cones, causing a shower of fresh seeds to fall onto a perfectly-prepared seedbed. When winter comes, snow blankets the Mariposa Grove. As the snowpack melts the following spring, sunlight, moisture, fresh seeds, ash, and mineral soil combine to create a sequoia nursery.<br /> <br /> To reduce the leaf litter and promote giant sequoia reproduction, the National Park Service began igniting \"prescribed burns,\" that are deliberately set and closely monitored by rangers, during spring and fall. When the forest returns to a more natural state, these management fires will most likely be discontinued. Then nature can resume its cycle of lightning-caused fires every five to twenty years.

Thomas “Tom” Hodgdon acquired land for grazing cattle in Aspen Valley, now within Yosemite National Park. In 1879, Tom hired workers to build an access road, and a two-story cabin, on the land. To build the two-story log cabin, he hired a Chinese American cowboy named Ah Hoy and a neighbor named Franklin Babcock. The Hodgdon family, ranchers from the San Joaquin Valley, grazed cattled on their homesteaded land in Aspen Valley each summer.</p> <p>Tom and family ran a ranching business, grazing cattle in nearby meadows. After these meadows became part of Yosemite National Park in 1890, U.S. Army troops enforced park regulations against grazing by dispersing cattle, and the Hodgdons lost grazing privileges. The family didn’t use the cabin for a while, and patrolling soldiers, and even Army horses, sheltered inside occasionally.</p> <p>No longer able to earn a living with livestock in Yosemite, the Hodgdon family adapted to make money from tourism. In 1882, as part of the Great Sierra Wagon Road, the Hodgdons’ access road was improved upon by Chinese workers, and extended to Tioga Pass for silver mining. When the Tioga Road opened to the public, tourist traffic increased through Aspen Valley. The Hodgdon family used their cabin, and created a complex of new buildings, used for tourist lodging.

The management of this huge park fell to a small group of 15 men who had served as cavalry scouts. Their duties were made more difficult by the fact that automobiles had been allowed to enter the park in August 1913. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a $5 fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations. <p>After twenty-three years protecting the park, the U.S. Army was called away from Yosemite in 1914, and civilians began to assume ranger roles. It was the job of these rangers to protect the natural resources, stop forest fires, and assist visitors. Their duties were made more difficult as automobiles had recently been allowed to enter the park.</p> <p>The ranger patrol cabin was built in 1915 to house rangers at Crane Flat, a busy road junction. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations. Along sections of the Big Oak Flat and Wawona roads, automobiles were only permitted to go east, downgrade, on odd hours and west, upgrade, on even hours. At Crane Flat and others Yosemite locations, rangers needed to live close to backcountry patrol routes and roadside stations where they assisted visitors arriving by automobile. In 1916 the National Park Service was created and the rangers living here became some of the first National Park Service Rangers.</p> <p>Gabriel Sovulewski, a Polish immigrant, embodied the administrative transition from the military to the National Park Service in Yosemite. He first saw Yosemite in 1895 while on a summer deployment to the park with the U.S. Army. In 1902, he left the Army and returned to Yosemite to work as a packer and guide. In 1906, Gabriel was placed in charge of Yosemite National Park, serving as the top park official for thirty years. During that time he directed the construction of trails and buildings such as the Ranger Patrol Cabin. Gabriel Sovulewski remained in Yosemite for the rest of his life, and is buried next to his wife, Rose in the Yosemite Cemetery.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/ranger-patrol-cabin.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln’s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father’s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father’s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments. This would start a 6-year correspondence, culminating in Jr.’s writing of the Organic Act, which would help solidify the creation of the NPS, keeping great natural wonders in the hands of the people.<br /> <br /> <em>Source</em>: \"Yosemite National Park,\" <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/yosemite-national-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <br /> For more information and primary resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4157,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157670860792970/\">Olmsted Archives on Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/08204\">Olmsted Online</a></p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/yosemite-national-park.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

The Yosemite Transportation Office was constructed in Yosemite Valley in 1910 by the Yosemite Valley Railroad Company as a transportation terminal and telecommunications hub. Visitors arriving by horse-drawn or auto stage used this office to make railroad and lodging reservations, place long-distance phone calls, or send telegrams. <p>The Yosemite Transportation Office was constructed in Yosemite Valley in 1910 by the Yosemite Valley Railroad Company as a transportation terminal and telecommunications hub.</p> <p>Starting in 1907, Yosemite-bound tourists could ride the railroad from Merced to El Portal, just outside the park, eliminating the bumpy, dusty, two-day stage ride. However, the final fourteen-mile leg of the journey from El Portal to Yosemite Valley was still made by stage, and later by autos.</p> <p>Upon arrival at this terminal in Yosemite Valley, passengers could book a stay in a hotel and make transportation arrangements with travel agents, who lived in the building’s back rooms. Despite its rustic design, the office provided modern conveniences. Visitors could make telephone calls or send telegrams to anywhere in the world. By 1914, automobiles were common in Yosemite, and in that year, horse-drawn stage service was discontinued. However, annual visitation to the park in 1915 doubled to 31,000. Consequently, stage operation was renewed but only for one additional year. In 1916, the era of stage travel ended and another began. The National Park Service, a federal agency created to preserve and manage our country's national parks, was established.</p> <p>The reliance on transportation companies for park access diminished greatly when the All-Year Highway (now California Highway 140) opened in 1927, and personal cars soon became the dominant means of transportation in Yosemite.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/yosemite-transportation-office.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Looking for economic opportunity and accompanied by two Monache/Yokuts Indians, Tharp first visited the Giant Forest in 1858. <br /> <br /> A stockman by trade, Tharp used nearby Log Meadow as a seasonal grazing pasture and lived in this tiny rustic cabin until the creation of Sequoia National Park in 1890. His goal was to raise cattle and sell beef to an expanding local population. <br /> <br /> Tharp adapted this 70-foot hollow sequoia log as the structure for his summer cabin. A fire had burned inside the tree, lining its interior with charcoal. He carved a window and made a shutter with horseshoe hinges. Tharp enclosed the open end of his log home with a shingled building and added a fireplace and chimney made from granite boulders. <br /> <br /> Tharp had limited resources to create this cabin among the trees, but the details really made this place his home. What is your favorite detail that he added? <br /> <br /> Text, right-hand column, first section titled \"Travelers and Friends\": A local tribal chief, Chief Chappo, invited Hale Tharp to visit the village of Pah-din, now called Hospital Rock. Tharp recounted that he and Chief Chappo were “the very best of friends,” and that he felt welcome as Chief Chappo introduced him to more than 600 local California Indians at the village. In the summer, Tharp and two Monache/Yokuts Indians traveled together along the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River, past Moro Rock, and through nearby Log Meadow to a place they called the “big tree forest.” Chief Chappo’s descendants believe that guides accompanied Tharp for his safety along the treacherous, higher-elevation routes and that Tharp must have earned their trust for them to share this valued place. <br /> <br /> Text, right-hand column, second section titled \"New Arrivals\": Early settlers arriving here in the Giant Forest came with a wide array of motivations.

The citizens of nearby Visalia were so impressed with their work, they insisted that one of the giant trees be named in Captain Young's honor. Young declined, asserting that 2,000-year-old living trees should not be diminished by attaching any human's name. He acquiesced when it was agreed upon that the person honored would be Booker T. Washington.<br /> <br /> The significance of this Giant Sequoia tree was forgotten over time. After nearly 100 years, this tree has been rediscovered, and in 2003-on the hundredth year anniversary of the tree's dedication-a rededication ceremony was performed to honor Charles Young and Booker T. Washington. A sequoia has been named for Charles Young and is nearby.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/booker-t-washington-tree.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Nature, people, and spirit share this space. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <em>place to go through</em>. It is also known as Hospital Rock.</h4> <p>This spot along the Kaweah River supports a diverse mix of animals, plants, and trees. The richness of this landscape made it an ideal location for <b><i>Pah-din</i></b>, a village that was home to hundreds of California Native Americans. Today, it is still an important place for the descendants of the village, and a site where people of many backgrounds come to rest, play, and explore the natural world.The Hospital Rock area features hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Snow, ice, and water carved the surrounding hillsides and valley floor. In this place, several large granite boulders provided temporary shelter or space for tribal gatherings. The area namesake rock, <i>Pah-din</i> or Hospital Rock, is a massive 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Like the landscape, the river is a life force. It is home to fish and insects, and sustains nearby plant life.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Civilian Conservation Corps</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the Hospital Rock landscape changed dramatically. Assigned to Hospital Rock, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed several landscaping and improvement projects. They also cut a new stone staircase leading to the pictograph, built the Big Pool Trail and tunnel, and built a historic vehicle water station. Many local Native Americans joined the Corps and contributed to its projects nationwide.</p> <h3>Connections between Land and People Exhibit</h3> <h4>Native American groups lived, interacted, and traded goods in this village for generations. They continue to gather here as land stewards to practice their culture, educate, restore native plants, and for spiritual and special events.</h4> <p>Native Americans have a deep connection with the land. When Hospital Rock was an active village, the people cared for the plants and woodland ecosystem in ways that promoted health and abundance. From this practice, they were able to harvest materials necessary to live and thrive. Even today, these tribal cultural practices remain a way of life.Life here included fishing and gathering foods, cultivating the land, trading, playing games, visiting, andconnecting to one’s spiritual beliefs.

People living here depended on it for warmth and cooking. They also used it to clear vegetation to improve visibility and productivity in forests and grasslands.In this area, Native Americans hunted game, such as deer, squirrels, birds, and fished for food. Theyalso gathered plants, acorns, seeds, berries, and roots.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Homeland</h4> <p>“This is an ancient site, a sensitive site.... People took care of each other here. There’s a welcome feeling here...the medicine is strong.”A connection with the land is critical to North Fork Mono Tribal Chairman Ron Goode. “Everything out here is our relations.” Traditional Ecological Knowledge has been passed down for generations by his people, and children today have strong relationships with the land. This traditional knowledge guides their restoration of damaged meadows and waterways in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This work benefits not only tribal lands, but also national forests and parks.</p> <h3>A Village Exhibit</h3> <h4>In this area, the Mono (Monache), the Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal connected with their neighboring tribes to form a vibrant community. These connections continue today.</h4> <p>Many groups lived, visited, gathered, and practiced traditions here. Historical accounts document more than 500 people occupying this village. Travelers stopped at the village to visit, rest, or trade. Runners and messengers used the extensive trails to deliver news about events such as fires. Tribal leaders are responsible for the safety and welfare of their people, including welcoming outsiders, negotiating with neighboring groups, and maintaining peace.By the 1860s, Native Americans left the Hospital Rock area. New settlers forced many out of the area, while others died from newly introduced diseases.Today, Mono (Monache), Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal live all over the world. Some live on rancherias, reservations, or other Indian lands. Their descendants maintain a strong connection to <i>Pah-din</i> (Hospital Rock) and often participate in park management decisions.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-A True Leader</h4> <p>The descendants of Chief Chappo remember him as a strong leader who was compassionate, honest, and decisive—a peacemaker and a healer. Responsible for the welfare of his people, Chappo lived peacefully at Hospital Rock for generations. In the 1860’s, when new settlers arrived, they brought disease and conflict to the area. Chappo made the difficult decision to leave his homeland to save his people. Today, his descendants share stories about his gifts, and work to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h3>Activity, Past and Present Exhibit</h3> <h4>Signs that <em>Pah-din</em> (Hospital Rock) was once a vibrant village are all around us.

Picture a village with dwellings (called nobi by the Mono people), children playing, women preparing food, and men getting ready for a hunt. This location inspired a way of life and created traditions and practices that continue today.Village women processed acorns into a flour that was a staple food. They made depressions in flat bedrock to create grinding holes, or mortars, and used cylindrical stones as pestles.Redbud shrubs provide strong, flexible shoots that were split or kept whole to weave into baskets. Elderberry shrubs were used for food, cultural uses, medicine, or ceremonial use.Items such as beads and obsidian (volcanic glass) may be found here. If you find an artifact, help us by leaving it where it is. Take a photo, note the location, and report your finding to park staff.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Weavers</h4> <p dir=\"rtl\" style=\"margin-right: 80px; text-align: left;\"><i></i><i>“The materials that make up a Native basket serve to ground it to an area. The weaver’s culture governed the techniques used to make it and the designs that adorn it. And the voices of tribal elders whisper through it.” </i>- BRYN BARABAS POTTER</p> <p>Weaving serves a practical purpose but is also an art. Nature not only provides materials but also inspires patterns. An active basket-making community continues to teach skills to the next generation of weavers.</p> <h3>Community Traditions Exhibit</h3> <h4>What memorable traditions occur here, past and present? The Hospital Rock area has a rich history of people, events, and activities that shape it and create a sense of community.</h4> <p>The granite rocks near the pictographs of Hospital Rock served many purposes such as a shelter, a place of healing, and a location for ceremonies. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <i>place to go through.</i>Every Native American society has healers, who practice traditional medicine to aid ailing community members. On occasions, healers cared for injured travelers here. The English name “Hospital Rock” was first used in 1873 after a pioneer recovered here from a trapping injury.Spirituality was prominent in the form of reverence for the natural world.

From past to present, many languages have been spoken here, connecting people to this space and to one another.</h4> <p>In the past, California Native American groups lived, met, and gathered here. They spoke a number of languages and dialects to trade goods, share news, and cooperate with others. Today, these languages are still heard throughout the Sierra range and foothills. People can tell a lot about their neighbors based on the way they say “hello.” A person’s language communicates to others who they are, where they come from, and how they live.Historically, California Native Americans each had their own language. However, each group spoke many languages to connect with their neighbors and fellow travelers.Today, travelers from all over the world rest, picnic, and enjoy nature here, whether they call this place Hospital Rock or<i> Pah-din</i>. While you’re here, listen for people speaking a variety of languages.Nature also has a language. The rustling of oaks, chirping of birds, calls of squirrels, and the roaring river flowing over granite boulders form the essential sounds of this landscape.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Our Language Lives</h4> <p>Language is Marie Wilcox’s life. According to Marie, “words matter and learning the language is important to our culture.” Marie is one of the last living speakers of the Wukchumni language. With the help of her family, Marie created a Wukchumni dictionary. Containing thousands of words and examples of their uses, the dictionary documents the living language of her people. As part of a movement to preserve our nation’s Native American languages, Marie’s work documents the art and heritage of the Wukchumni voice.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/hospital-rock-picnic-area-exhibits.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

In the springtime, streams and creeks swell to high levels as snowmelt makes its way down towards the Central Valley. Once the snow has melted, however, water levels drop significantly. By late summer, many water sources dry up completely. Inconsistent snowpack from year to year makes it difficult to predict what resources will be available for the parks' flora and fauna. By tracking water levels over time, park scientists can better understand this unique landscape.<br /> <br /> Are you interested in exploring watersheds in the Foothills? Join a park ranger at any point in the year to collect data as a community scientist. In order to be sensitive to the plants and animals that call these streams home, group sizes are limited to a maximum of 6 participants. Individuals with an interest in a longer-term volunteer commitment are encouraged to reach out.<br /> <br /> Call Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' Education Office at 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov for more information.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/marble-falls-trailhead.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Scientists and park managers have developed ways to use fire to maintain healthy ecosystems within the parks, including natural (lightning) fires and prescribed burns.<br /> <br /> Redwood Canyon also houses thousands of dogwood trees.

Water from natural sources such as creeks and springs should be purified. When hiking in a group, each person should be carrying water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Bright Angel Trail is considered the most popular hiking trail in the park. Well-maintained and graded for stock, it is fairly easy to walk down. This can be a blessing or a curse. Wide views of the inner canyon and distant formations often distract hikers from just how far down the trail they've walked. The return hike back up and out of the canyon is far more difficult and requires much more effort. Plan for at least twice as much time back up as it took to go down.<br /> <br /> While South Kaibab Trail follows a ridge line, Bright Angel Trail is tucked deep within a side canyon along a massive fault, which keeps the trail in this side canyon for the first few miles. The majority of the trail's elevation change takes place in the upper four miles via a series of switchbacks that seem endless. Views are framed by massive cliffs, with more plant and animal life thanks to a higher degree of shade and natural water sources. If you're interested in geology or wildlife, this is a trail with complementary features. You can expect to see mules on the trail as well. See below for more information.<br /> <br /> The trail levels out as it approaches Havasupai Gardens, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and over 2,000 vertical feet (925 meters)", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bright-angel-trail.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

This destination is an oasis within the canyon, home to the Havasupai People until they were forced to leave when the National Park was established. From here, you might consider the relatively flat (but very exposed) 3-mile (4.8-km) round trip hike to Plateau Point for sunrise or sunset.<br /> <br /> Hikers interested in planning a trip beyond these destinations should consult a park ranger.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> During late fall, winter, and early spring, temperatures regularly drop below freezing, and upper portions of this steep trail can become dangerously icy. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended during these times of year. Consult a park ranger for current trail conditions.<br /> <br /> Before heading down into the canyon, <strong>consult the signs at the trailhead</strong> for trip planning and <strong>current weather, trail information and trail closures</strong>. (or visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a> webpage).<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> Before your hike, it is critical to determine your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>—a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bright-angel-trail.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Thurber incorporated the cabin as part of his hotel, connecting the two structures first with a large circus tent and later with an actual wooden frame building.

The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today. The architect of the Bright Angel Lodge and its associated cabins, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, decided to renovate Buckey O'Neill's cabin as a guest lodge. It remains operating as one of Bright Angel Lodge's active guest cabins to this day.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/buckey-oneill-cabin.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

The small, teardrop-shaped parking area is fine for cars and small RVs, but larger vehicles and those towing trailers will find turning around a bit tight.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Prior to using the land for a cattle ranching venture, Martin Buggeln first became involved with Grand Canyon when he moved here in 1901 from Williams, Arizona. After purchasing the Bright Angel Hotel on the South Rim, Buggeln partnered with the newly arrived Santa Fe Railroad to provide tourist accommodations.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he became the first postmaster of the Village when he opened a post office in his hotel. As a community gathering place, the post office provided one of the few social outlets for the permanent residents of the developing Village. However, after only a few years in the hotel business, Buggeln sold his interest in Bright Angel Hotel to the Santa Fe Railroad. He had tired of the political infighting between hotel owners, the railroad, and public landholders regarding ownership rights of the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Buggeln bought the 160-acre (65 ha) Hance Ranch property and built a 17-room hotel on the land, although he never operated the hotel for tourists. Instead, he began a cattle operation that continued into the 1930s. Martin Buggeln died in 1939, and in 1948, the National Park Service bought the land from his second wife. At that time, it was the last privately owned property in the park east of Grand Canyon Village. All buildings on the property were removed in 1957.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/buggeln-picnic-area.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Gaze into one of the reflectoscopes and see a different perspective of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More About the Watchtower</h3> <p>With painstaking detail, Colter directed the placement of each rock and architectural accent in the Desert View Watchtower. Using mostly locally sourced rocks and reused timber, the tower appears to grow organically from the rim of the canyon itself, paying homage to the techniques and styles of local tribes while utilizing modern-day equipment and materials to strengthen the internal structure. <br /> <br /> As you approach the building you might see how well it blends into the environment. It is difficult to tell where the rock of the canyon walls end, and the tower begins. Colter said:<br /> <br /> <em>“First and most important, was to design a building that would become part of its surroundings; one that would create no discordant note against the time eroded walls of this promontory.”</em><br /> <br /> To obtain this result she insisted that the rocks not be cut or worked, so they would not lose the <em>“weathered surfaces so essential to blend it with the canyon walls”.</em><br /> <br /> Note, too, some of the intricate designs she had built into the tower. For example, look for the white decorative stones near the top, which fade out as the eye goes around the tower. She had seen this pattern at Chaco Canyon and thought it would break the monotony of this Watchtower. The built in cracks which are patterned from some of the ancient towers she had seen are deliberately designed. There are petroglyphs on some of the stones. Can you spot them?<br /> <br /> The internal steel framework of the Watchtower was designed and supervised by the bridge builders of the Santa Fe Railway company. Upon this framework, each exterior stone was selected and carefully placed to ensure exactly the look that Mary Colter was hoping to obtain.</p> <h3>Traveling to the Watchtower </h3> <p><strong>Park Shuttles are NOT provided to Desert View.

Grand Canyon Village sits near the southern head of this massive side canyon, which has formed along a geologic structure known as the Bright Angel Fault. Many faults, large and small, cut the rock layers of Grand Canyon, but the Bright Angel Fault is probably the most famous. Movement of rocks along this fault has created a major conduit for water flowing down to the Colorado River, including Garden Creek from the South Rim (fed by springs at Indian Garden, far below) and Bright Angel Creek from the North Rim (fed by Angel Spring and Roaring Springs, the source of all drinking water within the park). Since movement along faults causes breaks in the shear cliffs of Grand Canyon, they often serve as access points for trails descending from the canyon rims. Where the switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail descend through the break in the shear cliff of tan Coconino Sandstone several hundred feet below the rim, one can clearly observe the offset along the Bright Angel Fault. The displacement along this portion of the fault is about 200 feet (60 m), with the western side of the fault uplifted relative to the eastern side. However, this normal displacement along the Bright Angel Fault represents only the most recent chapter of its long history; like other major faults in Grand Canyon, the Bright Angel Fault traces its origin back to the formation of the proto-North American continent about 1.7 billion years ago.

The well-built trail eventually provided access to more tourists than miners, as Grandview Point provided one of the best access routes into the canyon at that time. Relatively undamaged segments of the original miner trail remain in the upper portion of Grandview Trail, testifying to the engineering prowess of the builders as they devised creative solutions to the problems that the landscape presented.<br /> <br /> The trail descends to the right of the established Grandview Point overlook. The Kaibab/Toroweap section traverses steep slopes, and the old trail is eroded in places, so careful attention is critical. Vertical steps were placed by constructing log \"cribs\" that were chained or pinned to the cliff face to provide a foundation for the trail where nature provided none. The exposure along these sections impresses some hikers to the point of being considered hazardous. Unfortunately, several of the historic cribs were swept away by landslides during the winter of 2005. Trail crews restored the trail, but not the historical context of the old logs. A series of sloping ledges at the top of the Coconino Sandstone cliff demands caution, especially when icy or wet. Be careful throughout the Kaibab and Toroweap sections - a fall here could have catastrophic consequences.<br /> <br /> The original cobblestone \"riprap\" trail construction remains throughout most of the Coconino section. Large slabs of sandstone placed edgewise provided a durable and labor intensive walking surface. The trail comes to the top of a dramatic east-facing gully at the contact between the Coconino Sandstone and Hermit Shale (known locally as Coconino Saddle), which offers tantalizing views into the upper valley of Hance Creek.

Today, the Hermit Trail still offers experienced, knowledgeable canyon backpackers a direct link to the excitement and romance of the early days at Grand Canyon. <p>Louis D. Boucher, the \"hermit\" of Hermit Creek basin, lived in this area for 20 years. Boucher built the Boucher Trail (west of the Hermit Trail) and seasonal residences at Dripping Springs and near Boucher Creek. Though socially active in the South Rim community, residents labeled Boucher a hermit because he lived alone.<br /> <br /> The modern trailhead is located just west of Hermits Rest.

Passage through the Kaibab Formation and Coconino Sandstone is via well-defined switchbacks. Most of the Hermit Trail was originally surfaced with large hand-fitted rock slabs that created a smooth walking surface. Ongoing erosion has claimed much of this remarkably labor-intensive paving, but a few isolated fragments survive, especially in the Coconino Sandstone. Fossilized animal tracks have been noted in many locations throughout the canyon, but they were first studied in detail along the Hermit Trail. Observant hikers can see a few of these fossilized lizard-like tracks in the lower half of the Coconino Sandstone.<br /> <br /> The trail enters Waldron Basin, a quiet, isolated pocket within the Hermit side canyon, at 1.2 miles (1.9 km). The Waldron Trail junction is encountered soon after at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), followed by the Dripping Springs Trail junction at 1.75 miles (2.8 km). To continue on the Hermit Trail, stay right at both junctions. Dripping Springs, however, does make an excellent day hike destination. After the Dripping Springs trail junction, the Hermit Trail drops down along the east side of Hermit Creek gorge. Santa Maria Spring is reached at 2.5 miles (4 km) along the trail, offering a trickle of water and a historic masonry rest house which provides welcome shade during the summer.<br /> <br /> Continuing on the Hermit Trail past this point is generally not recommended for a day hike during the summer. During cooler months, Lookout Point, an additional 1.5 miles (2.4 km) down the trail from Santa Maria Spring, is also a reasonable single-day option for those seeking a longer hike.

The Hermit Creek basin was the scene of one of the most aggressive of these improvement efforts. Initiated by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911, this program involved development of the rim and also included the construction of what was, at the time, a state-of-the-art rim-to-river trail.<br /> <br /> The Hermit Trail was built to serve a luxury campsite near Hermit Creek. Hermit Camp predated Phantom Ranch by 10 years and in its heyday was complete with a tramway from the rim, a functional automobile for transportation within the facility, and a Fred Harvey Company chef. Operations ceased in 1930, but for two decades Hermit Camp was the last word in gracious tourism below the rim. As is always the case at Grand Canyon, time and erosion have taken a heavy toll. The old Hermit Trail is today a mere shadow of its former self, but for experienced and knowledgeable canyon backpackers, the walk offers a direct link to the excitement and romance of the early days at Grand Canyon.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hermit-trail.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Built as a rest area at the end of scenic Hermit Road (also constructed by Fred Harvey), Hermits Rest was also the last bastion of civilization for those visitors preparing to descend down into Grand Canyon on Hermit Trail.<br /> <br /> Horse-drawn carriages, and later automobiles, operated by Fred Harvey, carried visitors on scenic tours along the Hermit Road, dropping them off here for a respite before the return trip to Grand Canyon Village. The distinctive style of this structure is unique and skillfully crafted out of native materials that blend in with the natural environment.<br /> <br /> Today, this location is frequented by hikers, travelers, and history enthusiasts that arrive by foot, bicycle, the Hermit Road (Red) Route shuttle bus, and, during the months of December through February, personal vehicles.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hermits-rest.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

One of them fired shots at the park ranger, who was found dead at the scene by a colleague later that day. His gun was holstered and concealed under his uniform jacket. The individuals, apparently members of The Black Panther organization, were later apprehended and convicted on evidence of deer poaching, stolen checks, drug possession, and the murder of Ken Patrick.<br /> <br /> Ken Patrick was laid to rest at the South Rim in Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery on August 9, 1973.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/ken-patrick-trail-point-imperial.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

From capturing unorthodox photos of hard-to-reach areas of the canyon to documenting their 101 days running the Colorado River on film with a motion-picture camera, Ellsworth and Emery revealed images that few had dreamed of. Selling their images in leather-bound books for three dollars each and touring the country to present their film lecture series, the Kolb brothers made a name for themselves and opened the eyes of a nation to this wonder of the world.<br /> <br /> For decades, the Kolb brothers continued to make a living out of Kolb Studio on Grand Canyon's South Rim. Later in life, when their contractual agreements with the park ended, the National Park Service actually wanted to demolish this studio in the 1960s. The architecture wasn't quite in line with the style and theme of other buildings in the park. After several years of quibbling between Emery and the agency, the structure was saved when Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966, legislation that effectively protected park structures over 50 years old from being destroyed.</p> <h3>Tour the Private Residence</h3> <p><strong>Enter the little seen depths of this five-story building for a behind the scenes tour of the Kolb family's private home and photography studio. </strong></p> <ul> <li>Your guide will weave stories of the Kolb family members.<br /> </li> <li><strong>Days Offered:</strong> Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday</li> <li><strong>Time</strong>: 1 pm | 60 minutes (one hour) </li> <li> <p><strong>Participant Size:</strong> 8</p> </li> <li><strong>Meet Location</strong>: Gallery downstairs (access is through the store).<br /> </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/experience-grand-canyon/guided-tours/kolb-studio-tour\">Additional information about the tour</a> </li> <li><strong>Price:</strong> $30/person | <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/reservations?%2Freserve%2Ftt3-kolb-studio\">Register online</a></li> </ul>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/kolb-studio.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Just west of El Tovar Hotel, \"The Lookout\" is a neat, comfortable, and rustic studio of stone and log timbers.

Generally rectangular in plan, the small building is constructed of coursed rubble masonry.<br /> <br /> Commissioned to directly compete with the Kolb brothers and Kolb Studio, Mary Colter designed Lookout Studio in a similar manner as Hopi House: to imitate the stone dwellings of the Pueblo Indians of the southwest. Inspired by the natural forms of the landscape around the site, she used these influences to guide her design.<br /> <br /> The parapet rooflines and stone chimneys mimic the irregular shapes of surrounding bedrock. The interior of the building is divided into several levels, with structural log work exposed in posts, beams, and ceiling joists. The floor is scored concrete and the interior walls are exposed stone. Because of all of the viewing windows around the walls of the structure (which naturally feature Colter's trademark baby blue window frames), the interior is considerably lighter than most of Colter's other buildings.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lookout-studio.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

The Fred Harvey Company and the Santa Fe Railroad constructed the original \"Motor Lodge\" here in 1927. Traveling by automobile to the parks was quickly becoming fashionable. Rather than having to travel by train or carriage, people could journey in their own automobiles.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s, 36 cabins were added and 22 cabins were moved from Bright Angel Lodge. Many of the 120 cabins were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by more contemporary two-story hotel rooms in 1968. The only architectural component remaining from historic lodge buildings are the original stone pillars.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/maswik-lodge.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

A wealthy businessman from Chicago, Mather was avid conservationist and supporter of public lands, who moved to Washington D.C. in 1915 to help found the National Park Service. Appointed its first director in 1917 he continued to promote park access, development, and use until he left office in 1929. <br /> <br /> Mather believed that magnificent scenery should be the first criterion in establishing a national park, and made efforts to have new parks established before the lands were developed for other purposes. Mather always wished to have the parks supported by avid users, who would then communicate their support to their elected representatives.

Trained as a geologist he authored numerous scientific papers on Grand Canyon rocks and strata as well as the canyon's natural resources. Working at the canyon until 1940 Eddie McKee helped to lay the frame work for modern Interpretation of Grand Canyon resources and greatly expanded the collective knowledge of both the ancient environments and conditions that formed Grand Canyon's rock layers as well as the forces and processes necessary to carve the vast canyon we see today. </p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/mckee-amphitheater.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

His work helped to create many national parks. Explore this point for a good spot to watch the shadows and changing light throughout the day, just as the artist did.</p> <h3>Thomas Moran</h3> <p>In 1873, Hudson River School artist Thomas Moran joined John Wesley Powell on his exploratory expeditions of Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau. Shortly after his return, Moran set to work on a canvas equal in size and ambition to his earlier 1872 painting from Yellowstone National Park, \"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\". In 1874, Congress purchased the result, \"The Chasm of the Colorado\" (1873-1874, National Museum of American Art) for $10,000. It became the second of Moran's western landscapes to hang in the United States Capitol, and is now part of the Smithsonian Institution, residing primarily at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p> <h3>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h3> <p>Geology is a prominent feature at any Grand Canyon viewpoint, but especially so at Moran Point. From here, all three main rock groups of Grand Canyon are clearly visible.<br /> <br /> The horizontal sedimentary layers of rock that make up the majority of what we see in Grand Canyon's depths are known as the Layered Paleozoic Rocks. Beneath these relatively flat-lying layers are the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, which represent a significant portion of the canyon's geologic record even though they are only exposed in a few isolated sections of the canyon. These tilted layers are only visible from a few select viewpoints along the rim, including here at Moran Point. The black Vishnu Schist and pink Zoroaster Granite, as well as a few other associated metamorphic and igneous rocks are collectively known as the Vishnu basement rocks. These are the oldest rocks in the canyon, and thus are found far below near the Colorado River, beneath the over-lying sedimentary layers.<br /> <br /> The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/moran-point.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

The short segment of the Colorado River visible here is cutting through a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, with tall cliffs of brown Shinumo Sandstone above. These vibrant orange layers of rock can also be seen on this side of the river, directly below the viewpoint to the northwest. Beyond these layers, on the far side of the canyon, one can observe four distinct layers of rock sitting on the Vishnu basement rocks. In order, these are a sill of black Cardenas Basalt, purple layers of Bass Formation, a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, and brown cliffs of Shinumo Sandstone.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/moran-point.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

Here hikers will find potable water (mid-May to mid-October) and pit toilets. No emergency phone is available.<br /> <br /> Switchbacks continue to the massive cliffs of Redwall Limestone, where for long stretches the trail has been blasted out of the cliff.

You can see this amazing pipeline as it stretches across the Colorado River on the underside of the Silver Bridge from Bright Angel Trail.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Please consider seasonal variations in trail conditions. </strong><br /> <br /> During winter months, the upper section of North Kaibab trail can be ice-covered and snowbound. North Rim hikers must be prepared for extreme winter conditions with extra food, clothing layers, and tractions devices.<br /> <br /> During hotter months (May - September), it is critical that hikers begin their hike well before dawn or after 3 p.m. Success and enjoyment depends on the amount of time spent planning ahead and preparing for all conditions. Success in the summer can be as simple as staying off the trail and out of the sun between 10 am-4 pm. Hiking the entire North Kaibab Trail in a single day is not recommended, particularly in summer, as it would be extremely difficult to avoid hiking in the heat of the day.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your itinerary with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke.

A two-way shuttle bus stop makes visiting here easy and a nice quick option for those limited on time.</p> <h3>What's in a name?</h3> <p>The story of Grand Canyon as we know it is tied directly to John Wesley Powell. As a geologist Powell grew interested in exploring the unknown canyons of the Green and Colorado rivers. He studied reports from earlier expeditions, but in the late 1800s there wasn't much to go on and most of what was available was inaccurate and jaded by the perceptions of early explorers. Gathering support and supplies from the Smithsonian Institution, railroads, educational institutions, and Congress for his expedition down the Green River. He designed his own boats and gathered a makeshift crew of ex-trappers, mountain men, and Civil War veterans like himself. The expedition launched four boats from Green River, Wyoming in May 24, 1869 to explore the course of the river, fill in the blank spots that littered maps of the southwest, and to gather scientific data.<br /> <br /> After three summer months spent exploring the upper canyons of the Colorado River, the expedition passed the Paria River on August 4 hungry, exhuasted both mentally and physically, and with only musty apples, spoiled bacon, wet flour, and coffee remaining to sustain them they entered the last and greatest of the canyons. The scientific expedition had turned into a fight for their very survival as they entered into Grand Canyon. Powell referred to Grand Canyon as “<em>our granite prison</em>” and described an almost unbroken series of rapids that the expedition ran, lined, or portaged, praying all the while for an end to the ordeal. On August 28, the canyon ended and the river became relatively quiet once again. They had survived, and in doing so became the first recorded people to successfully navigate from Green River, Wyoming to the Black Canyon of Arizona/Neveda.<br /> <br /> After a near disatrous first trip that cost Powell’s most of his notes and scientific data, a few boats, and multiple men, he secured full federal funding to a second trip. Powell gathered a new crew, this time including amateur scientists and educated men, and he began a second expedition on May 22, 1871. Between his two trips down the river Powell gathered invaulable information and data and literally helped to put Grand Canyon on a map. Further studies in the area over the next few years, by both Powell and his peers", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/powell-point.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

You cannot improve upon it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.\"<br /> <br /> On June 8, 1906, Roosevelt signed into legislation the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a> , which enabled the President \"...to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments..\"<br /> <br /> On January 11, 1908, Roosevelt officially recognized the significance of Grand Canyon by using this same order to proclaim it a national monument.

The idea was to build a permanent building near a site on the canyon rim already used for services, including a very popular Easter Sunrise service.<br /> <br /> Harold E. Wagoner, a member of the board of directors of the Church Architectural Guild of America, was selected as architect. Working within National Park Service guidelines to respect the natural environment and American Indian culture, he designed a structure that reflected the architectural style of a kiva, a place of worship used by native people in the Southwest. This design worked well since the National Park Service also required that no towers or specific religious symbols be used.<br /> <br /> Because the initial building site was on the rim of the canyon just west of today's Hermits Rest Route (red) shuttle stop, plans called for the main auditorium to have a sweeping canyon view from a multi-story, curved window placed behind the altar. A special hydraulic lift would raise and lower at least three different altar configurations for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant services. An organ placed on a small balcony, with wind chests and pipes located at different sections of the main chapel, would provide stereophonic sound effects.<br /> <br /> Even as fundraising efforts reached around the world, questions about whether the rim was an appropriate location for the structure resulted in delays. Some even argued that the building only remotely resembled a kiva, instead looking more like a huge spacecraft perched on the canyon rim. Donations were never quite enough to realize Wagoner's plans, and federal funding became involved. The building was ultimately redesigned and relocated away from the edge of the canyon. An appropriate site was chosen next to the existing Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, and Shrine of the Ages was completed by 1970.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service took over ownership of the building in 1975, along with all maintenance, operational, and administrative duties.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/shrine-of-the-ages.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

The only source of water is at the Colorado River. In general, Grand Canyon is infamous for summer heat and the Tanner Trail is noted for being unusually hot.<br /> <br /> The summer sun rises early and sets late in this wide-open area. The absence of water produces sparse vegetation and little shade. River runners call this part of the Grand Canyon \"Furnace Flats\".<br /> <br /> Avoid this trail during warm/hot weather over 95°F (35°C).</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p><strong>Strongly consider talking with a park ranger before attempting this hike.</strong><br /> <br /> The trail is <strong>steep</strong> and <strong>no water is available until the river</strong>. Expect to hike and climb over unstable footpaths and boulder fields. Your best option for a day hike would be to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. To reach just this point, be prepared for 1.6 miles (2.6 km) over a descent of 1,700 feet (518 m). Hiking beyond the 75 Mile Creek Saddle is exposed and can be extremely hot.<br /> <br /> There are no water sources along the trail until the Colorado River, a 9 mile trek (14.5 km) and elevation change of 4,650 feet (1,417 m) each way. The elevation at Lipan Point is 7,350 feet (2,240 m) and at the Colorado River it is 2,700 feet (823 m). However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult and time-consuming to purify.<br /> <br /> If you choose to hike down what remains of a pioneer-era trail, you will head immediately down the gully east of Lipan Point. The upper section of the Tanner Trail is narrow, badly eroded, and can be difficult to follow, especially after a storm. The trail stays on the slopes east of the bottom of the gully through the Toroweap Formation and switches to the west side at the top of the Coconino Sandstone. Rockslides in the Coconino Sandstone have covered the original trail in places, forcing hikers to improvise short sections. The trail descends steeply across the slope west of the bed of gully nearly all the way to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. A prime canyon view at the saddle is the reward for a couple of miles of notably unstable hiking. The reward comes with a price - hiking out of the canyon from even here is one of the more rugged, steeper climbs in the park.<br /> <br /> Hiking beyond this point requires detailed planning and experience hiking in a desert environment.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>The Colorado River is the sole source of water.

On either side of you, tall and densely clustered pine or aspen trees abruptly end at the edges of this large meadow. The open area that you see extends for miles.<br /> <br /> Why would these vibrant forests suddenly stop invading an open, rolling grassy landscape? Several factors are linked to this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> <b>Wildfire</b> has certainly played a role.<br /> <br /> <b>Drainage</b> is also a limiting factor. Trees are skilled at soaking up water, though seedlings may have a hard time growing in locations exposed to greater amounts of sun, rain, and snow.<br /> <br /> <b>Soil chemistry</b> is also a consideration. Natural toxins and higher alkaline concentrations can prevent the growth of woody plants.<br /> <br /> <b>Competition</b> is significant. For example, Ponderosa pine trees struggle to grow in areas dominated by established grasses. <b>Variations in bedrock</b> (primarily Kaibab limestone) may also affect how deep or suitable an area is for seedling growth. And grazing <b>wildlife</b>, like mule deer and bison, keep vegetation low and trimmed.<br /> <br /> You can also observe this phenomenon along the beginning of Cape Royal Road, here on the North Rim.</p> <h3>Bison Safety</h3> <ul> <li>Bison are wild animals and are unpredictable.</li> <li>Maintain a distance of 100 feet (30 m) from bison.</li> <li>When the bison are within 100 feet (30 m) of the road, it is recommended to view wildlife from inside a vehicle.</li> <li>Please use established gravel or paved pull-outs to park vehicles completely off the roadway (all wheels right of the white line).

The first train arrived in 1901, bringing passengers ready to marvel at Grand Canyon's one-of-a-kind views. Today this feeling continues as folks step off the train, eager to make the walk up towards El Tovar Hotel and the canyon rim.<br /> <br /> Constructed in 1909-1910, the Train Depot is part of the Grand Canyon National Park National Historic Landscape District and a designated National Historic Landmark. Designed by architect Francis W. Wilson of Santa Barbara, California, the log and wood-frame structure is two stories high.<br /> <br /> Originally, the downstairs was designated for station facilities and the station agent's family inhabited the upstairs. Today, the first floor is used for railway passenger services. The building is one of 14 log depots constructed in the United States and one of only three remaining. Of the three, the Train Depot is the only one in which logs were used as the primary structural material and which still serves an operating railroad. The depot's logs are squared on three sides creating bearing surfaces, flat interior surfaces, and a rustic exterior appearance.<br /> <br /> Just beyond the depot is the El Tovar Hotel, built in 1905 by the Santa Fe Railroad. The structure is the signature hotel along the rim. The railroad built the Train Depot five years after the hotel and placed it conveniently close for the rail passengers.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/train-depot.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}

He lived and painted at the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, producing a large collection of watercolors prized for their geologic detail. Widforss tried to capture the Grand Canyon environment as he saw it then. That environment has changed over the years as natural and human forces continue to reshape a picture characterized by monumental change through the eons. The geologic features, plant life, and historic features along this trail all provide glimpses of these past and present environments-and future ones as well.<br /> <br /> Previously, Widforss Point had been called McKinnon Point. Colonel H. McKinnon, a British visitor, stopped here in 1892 after a successful hunting trip on the Kaibab Plateau with W.S. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. He left a note in a tin can at the point to commemorate his triumph.</p>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/places/000/widforss-trail.htm", "source": "nps_api", "last_updated": ""}
