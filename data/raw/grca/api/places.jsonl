About halfway along the paved Cape Royal Trail from the parking area, a second paved trail leads left (east) to an observation platform, and an unpaved trail along the top of Angel’s Window. The Angels Window trail leads down a slight slope to a fork. Take the left fork to continue along a slightly narrower path that curves around to the right to a paved, stone-lined observation platform, 15 feet (five meters) wide by 10 feet (three meters) deep. To the left is the towering Vishnu Temple. To the right, the massive, curved walls and flat top of Wotans Throne. Two, three-foot tall wayside panels mounted on angled, metal reading rails stand side by side along the canyon side of the platform. The left-hand panel describes the changing colors of the Colorado River. The right-hand panel encourages you to listen to the sounds of the canyon. Descriptions of these two panels are included in the sub-script below. Note a wooden park bench in a small grove of trees at the far, right-hand side of the platform. Be mindful of the rocky platform border when moving to the bench. Moving back up the trail from the observation platform to the fork, a second asphalt trail to the left slopes down about 20 feet (six meters) to set of uneven stone steps and a dirt and gravel trail. The uneven dirt trail winds further down among a series of large boulders, then moves down three more stone steps to a path along the edge of the canyon. Four-foot tall metal guardrails flank the trail on either side. Note the path narrows as it crosses onto the top of Angel’s Window itself. The path continues east to a large, rocky expanse on top of the rock formation, 50 feet (15 meters) long by 25 feet (eight meters) wide, with metal guardrails all around. The River Red Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon with a view of the winding, reddish brown Colorado River at the bottom fills the face of the first wayside panel at the left. Entitled “The River Red,” words at the top of the panel read: Is the Colorado River clear, rusty brown, or emerald green today? Before the 1963 construction of Glen Canyon Dam just upstream of Grand Canyon, the river flowed a sediment-filled red and was called “the river colored red”, or Rio Colorado. It was described as “too thick to drink, and too thin to plow.” Sediments act as liquid sandpaper, carving the canyon, but that effect is now drastically curtailed. The clear green water that flows through Grand Canyon today is sediment-starved. The sediment is choked back by the dam and deposited in Lake Powell. It is only after spring snowmelt or when the summer monsoons arrive that the river flows red (like photo below), as side streams flush sediment into the Colorado. The first of two inset color photographs at the left shows a large dam on the river, nestled between high rock walls at the left and right. A caption reads: Glen Canyon Dam stifles the cutting and scouring power of the Colorado River. The cold, clear water discharged from the dam has drastically altered the ecology of the river, forever changing the web of life. The second, circular color photograph shows an emerald green segment of the Colorado River, with a diagonal line pointing from the river in the inset photograph to the river in the main panel photograph. A caption reads: Today’s sediment-starved river erodes rather than replaces beaches. Listen Wayside Panel At top of the second wayside panel at the right, text reads: Listen Stand still, be quiet, close your eyes. . .what do you hear? Is it a natural or human-caused sound? Can you hear a distant Colorado River rapid roar? Is something else masking its sound? Is one sound more desirable or more soothing? What value do you place on the sound of falling rain or the wing beat of a passing raven? National parks allow us to enjoy landscapes and soundscapes. But natural sounds are slowly and incrementally being covered up by noises that did not exist in parks until recently. Park managers must limit the array of mechanized disturbances that encroach upon the acoustic values of the park. Hearing is the only option for experiencing certain aspects of Grand Canyon—whistling canyon winds, howling coyotes, its immense quiet. Without limits on human noises, would your Grand Canyon visit be diminished? A series of three color photographs fills the left side of the panel. At the top, the first photograph shows a bright white lightning strike above a cloudy, blue-tinged view of the canyon. Questions read: “What value do you place on the sound of thunder? On quiet?” At the middle left, a waterfall cascades between some rocks, splashing into a green pool below. Text reads, “Natural sounds have powerful effects on our emotions, attitudes, and memories.” At the bottom left, a lone hiker stands in silhouette against a sun-drenched rock wall. Words read, “The quieter a place is, the more sensitive we become to human-caused noises. What can you do to lessen your noise?” A panoramic view of the canyon fills the right side of the panel, with a black bird soaring high overhead. Words read, “Listen for the wing beat of a passing raven.”", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "b31f9883-e752-4ccb-a9d7-519a899a9621", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Scenic Overlook", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Twenty feet (6 m) to the canyon side of the trail, a three-foot (1 m) tall by six-foot (2 m) wide square stone altar stands roughly six feet (2 m) from the rim of Grand Canyon, near the end of a flat, 30-foot (9 m) wide by 60-foot (18 m) long open, pebble-strewn landing. Be mindful stepping over a line of rocks bordering the edge of the asphalt trail onto the loose footing of the landing. Touch the stones that form the altar. Facing north down into the canyon, numerous switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail run up to and past 3-Mile Resthouse, and continue into the distance toward a stand of trees at Indian Garden far below. To the right across the chasm, perched on the edge of the canyon cliffs, is the multi-level dark brown Kolb Studio surrounded by evergreen trees below and behind the building. To the right of the studio, hikers enter and leave the canyon at the Bright Angel Trailhead. Above the trailhead, a few parking lots in the Village sit behind Bright Angel Lodge. The turreted top of El Tovar Hotel rises in the background, high above the rim. Located opposite the Rim Trail Worship Site on the other side of the asphalt path, away from the canyon, is a several-hundred-square-foot (90 meters square) gently-sloping rocky area filled with fossils. Note that once off the Rim Trail, the terrain quickly becomes rough, uneven and rocky, interspersed throughout with prickly pear cactus, juniper, and fir trees. Rocky escarpments stand exposed across the field, some three- to four-feet (1 to 1.2 m) high and tens of feet (10 m) long. On this west side of the Bright Angel Fault line, sedimentary rock layers have been uplifted, exposing an amazing diversity of rock formations with an abundance of fossils and trace fossils hidden within the youngest layer of Grand Canyon, the Kaibab Limestone. Common marine fossils include crinoids, animals that had a column-shaped body, created by a series of discs stacked together, topped by a cup-like head feeding structure radiating out like feathery arms. Shelled marine animals known as brachiopods had two asymmetrical shells, or valves. Several different species of brachiopods can easily be found here.Colonial animals called bryozoans produced lacy structures on hard surfaces or stick structures that stood up in ancient seas. Some solitary coral embedded the pointed end of its horn in the soft sediment for stability with a wider upright cup-like end. Sponge fossils are abundant as well. When they hardened into rock, they are more resistant to erosion and often stick out as large knobs or nodules from the surrounding limestone. Animals burrowed through the soft sediment at the bottom of ancient seas. Look for all manner of preserved burrows that were filled in with sediment. These could be long, short, wide, or thin tubular-looking structures. Many plant fossils also remain, such as small pines and ginkgoes. Most of the plant fossils are impressions called trace fossils, left behind in the mud of an ancient river system. Note that it is illegal to dig up, relocate, and/or remove fossils from Grand Canyon National Park. If you find a fossil, please leave it for others to discover and scientists to study. You are welcome to take a picture or make a drawing of the fossil, then go to one of the visitor centers to see if a park ranger can help you identify it.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Tactile Exhibit"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Grand Canyon Village", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Fossil Site", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Continue 10 feet (3 m) forward across the stone floor of the lobby to the 25-foot (8 m) long main registration desk at the left. Three massive log pillars spaced evenly across the width of the desk rise 15 feet (4.5 m) high to an exposed timber ceiling. Interior finishes included hand-sawn logs, adobe, and local limestone. Directly opposite the desk, a 10-foot (3 m) wide stone floor corridor leads to a gift shop at the left, a restaurant straight ahead, and a bar at the right. Note that about 8 feet (2.4 m) beyond the far end of the desk is a large, 10-foot (3 m) wide by 8-foot (2.4 m) tall, limestone fireplace with a couple wooden benches at the left and right up a small 6-inch (150 cm) step. Another hallway to the left at the far end of the desk leads to a water fountain and an ATM machine. The Bright Angel History Room is on the right. A set of restrooms is available straight ahead down this hallway and down a small flight of six stairs. Outside, on the canyon side of the lodge, a flagstone bench with a stone slab back rings a planter at the center of a 100-foot (30 m) long by 80-foot (24 m) wide flagstone terrace. Several other stone benches sit across the terrace, and there is a soda fountain and ice cream shop toward the east side of the building. At the far eastern end of the lodge is the Arizona Room restaurant, with its own separate entrance. From a position facing the Bright Angel Lodge reception desk, move to the far right-hand side of the desk and turn left. Move about 15 feet (4.5 m) forward, and turn right to move across the stone floor, then over a wooden threshold and through a set of eight-foot wide wooden sliding pocket doors onto a carpeted floor. You are in a 25-foot (8 m) wide by 20-foot (6 m) deep room with exposed timbers. The Bright Angel History Room highlights the legacy of Fred Harvey, Mary Jane Colter, and the Santa Fe Railway at Grand Canyon National Park and throughout the Southwest. On the wall to your left and along the left-hand wall are a series of exhibits about Fred Harvey in Arizona. On the wall to your right are a series of exhibits on Harvey at the Canyon, including an open, three-seat carriage with a roof. Four six-foot (2 m) tall floor-standing glass-enclosed display cases in the center left and right of the room display artifacts used and sold in Harvey's company restaurants and gift shops along the Santa Fe main line from Chicago to Los Angeles. A small gift shop and check-out counter sit in the back-right corner. On the opposite side of the room from the door, two five-foot (1.5 m) square picture windows frame a 10-foot (3 m) tall by 10-foot (3 m) wide stone fireplace. Designed by Mary Colter, its construction mirrors a typical cross-section of the canyon's geology. The roughly triangular outline represents the alternating slopes and cliffs seen in the profile of the canyon's walls. Be mindful of the two-inch (5 cm) high dark-stone Vishnu Schist that forms the hearth at the bottom and the metal andirons at the front left and right. Feel how the rock layers of the fireplace mimic the canyon. Touch the diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup next to the fireplace opening, topped by the narrow horizontal layers of the Paleozoic era. The top layer is the Kaibab Formation, the youngest and uppermost layer of rock in Grand Canyon. Five steps at the front left of the one-story limestone brick Bright Angel Lodge lead up under a simple shallow-pitched gable roof, forming a 10-foot (3 m) deep by 50-foot (15 m) wide covered gabled porch supported by peeled log posts. Six large exposed timbers support a triangular sloping shingled roof, 20-feet (6 m) tall at the center over the main entrance. Designed by architect Mary Jane Colter, Bright Angel Lodge is a complex of cabins around a central lodge building, directly on the edge of the canyon. Four windows penetrate the stone façade of the lodge. Two glass and metal hurricane lamps hang eight-feet (2.4 m) high to the left and right of the main entrance. A brightly painted eight-foot (2.4 m) wide wood and glass vestibule stands in front of the doors with blue and yellow vertical stripes, inlaid with red and white triangles outlined in black. Shed-roofed appendages create a layered effect for the mass of the main lodge. Outside on the canyon side of the lodge, a 100-foot (30 m) long by 80-foot (24 m) wide flagstone terrace leads right up to a 3-foot (1 m) tall limestone wall on the edge of the rim.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/bright-angel-lodge-cabins/", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "0", "amenities": ["Accessible Rooms", "ATM/Cash Machine", "Audio Description", "Automated Entrance", "Automated External Defibrillator (AED)", "Baby Changing Station", "Benches/Seating", "Bicycle - Rack", "Bus/Shuttle Stop", "Fire Extinguisher", "First Aid Kit Available", "Food/Drink - Bar/Alcohol For Sale", "Food/Drink - Cafeteria", "Food/Drink - Coffee", "Food/Drink - Ice Cream", "Food/Drink - Restaurant/Table Service", "Food/Drink - Snacks", "Food/Drink - Vending Machine/Self Service", "Gifts/Souvenirs/Books", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Information", "Information - Maps Available", "Information - Ranger/Staff Member Present", "Information Kiosk/Bulletin Board", "Parking - Auto", "Recycling", "Restroom", "Restroom - Accessible", "Restroom - Family", "Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Telephone", "Toilet - Flush", "Trash/Litter Receptacles", "Water - Bottle-Filling Station", "Water - Drinking/Potable", "Wheelchair Accessible", "Wheelchairs Available"], "managedByOrg": "Grand Canyon Lodges (Xanterra)", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Village Historic District", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Historic Lodge", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

From A D Stop 23, the asphalt path to Bright Angel Point continues about a quarter mile (400 meters) east. Note the paved path becomes increasingly steep, and there are no guardrails along the path to Bright Angel Point. The paved Bright Angel Point Trail leads out the spine of the ridge to Bright Angel Point. This trail is steep in places, with drop-offs and stairs, and provides dramatic views into Roaring Springs and Bright Angel Canyons. At the end of the trail is a narrow overlook, surrounded by four-foot (one meter) tall metal railings. A three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail stands at the edge of the rim at the far end of the overlook. Entitled “Breaking Ground,” the panel discusses the fracturing that created Bright Angel fault. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Breaking Ground Wayside Panel A color photograph of the canyon view from this location at Bright Angel Point fills the panel. At the top left, words read: Breaking Ground Look down Bright Angel Canyon where North Kaibab Trail winds. The Earth’s crust fractured in this area, lifting one side of the rock layers and lowering the other, creating a fault. The trail follows this fault into the canyon. Water also follows the fault. Springs, like Roaring Springs, are able to flow because the groundwater has reached impermeable rock, where it spreads out sideways and leaks out of the canyon walls as springs. At the left, a white label and line indicate the location of Walhalla Plateau. At the bottom center, a second white label points out Bright Angel Fault. The deep fault continues to the right, all the way to a third label at the right of the panel, Phantom Ranch.

The length of the trail is exposed to the elements; watch out for thunderstorms during the summer months and seek shelter in the Grand Canyon Lodge if you see lightning or hear thunder. </p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance:</strong> 0.5 miles (0.8 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong> Minimal<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/northrimstatus.htm\">North Rim - Current Status and Closures</a></strong></li> </ul>", "audioDescription": "A D Stop 21, Bright Angel Point Amphitheater + Wayside. 1 minute. The Ranger talk area is located to the southeast of Grand Canyon Lodge along the Bright Angel Point trail. From a position along the access ramp at the back of the lodge complex, move about 250 feet (75 meters) east away from the lodge complex along a concrete sidewalk. Continue past several cabins at the left and right, and through a small grove of ponderosa pine, to where the pavement changes from concrete to asphalt. Continue about 75 feet (23 meters) to a number of wooden benches arranged in a semi-circle at the left. A wooden sign at the left tells us that during the season, ranger programs are held here daily. At the far side of the Bright Angel Point Amphitheater, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the right, a mere 10 feet (three meters) from the rim, talks about how the different horizontal layers of the canyon were formed. A description of this panel, entitled “Layered Environments,” is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Layered Environments Wayside Panel A color photograph of the canyon from this vantage point fills the left side of the panel. Words at the top left read: Layered Environments Tropical seas, coastal beaches, sand dunes, swamps, lagoons, and Sahara-like deserts are encapsulated within the horizontal layers that fill the view. The upper five layers of prominently stacked rocks record 70 million years of rising and falling sea levels. The limestone layers equate to shallow sea environments, sandstone layers mean sandy beaches or dunes, while shale layers translate to mud flats, swamps, or coastal plains. How do we know all this? The rocks tell us, through their fossils, mineral grains, and structures. Beneath the text, white lettering and lines point to the different formations. Top to bottom on the image, there is Kaibab limestone, the Toroweap Formation, Coconino Sandstone, the Hermit Formation, and the Supai Group. At the right, several color illustrations depict the environments that gave rise to these formations, in that same order. At the top, a shark and other ancient sea creatures swim in an ocean, above many plants and shelled creatures on the seabed. Text reads: The Kaibab sea advanced as far as modern-day eastern Arizona, depositing marine fossils including crinoids, shells, and shark’s teeth. A mix of beach (sandstone) and sea (limestone) environments were embedded in the Toroweap, indicating a short advance and retreat of the sea. In the second image, a reptilian creature slithers across wide sand dunes. Text reads: Crossbed sands in the Coconino Sandstone depict scenes of shifting sand dunes, where reptiles left their tracks. In a third image, large animals, insects, and plants thrive by a marshy lake. Words read: The Hermit Formation was once a broad coastal plain evidenced by deposits of silt, mud, and fine-grain sand with an abundance of fern and animal track fossils. The last image at the bottom right depicts a wide expanse of shallow pools and plants across a sandy landscape. Words read: The Supai Group’s mix of shale, siltstone, sandstone, and limestone represents a period of rapidly changing coastlines and rising and falling sea levels. A quote from John Strong Newberry at the bottom left reads: Nowhere on the earth’s surface . . . are the secrets of its structure so revealed as here. A D Stop 22, Wayside 1 – On path to Bright Angel Point. ½ minute. About 75 feet (23 meters) east along the asphalt path from the Bright Angel Point Amphitheater, the path turns right down an increasing decline. About 40 feet (12 meters) further along, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the left discusses where the drinking water in the canyon comes from. A description of this panel, entitled “Drink in the View,” is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Drink in the View Wayside Panel A color photograph of a tall, rocky cliff with a gushing stream of water falling from its base fills the right side of the panel. Text at the top left reads: Drink in the View You have reached a special view, overlooking Roaring Springs Canyon. Drink in the canyon view here—literally. Roaring Springs provides drinking water for both the North and South rims. If you fill your bottle at the lodge or campground, you are drinking Roaring Springs water. At the left, the first of three, circular, inset color photographs shows the rim of the canyon covered in snow. Text reads: Because the North Rim is higher than the South Rim, it receives more precipitation, particularly snowfall. As the snow melts water seeps into the ground. The second inset color photograph shows a stream of water rushing down a rocky, green slope. A caption reads: Some of the water moves quickly through cracks in the rock to the Roaring Springs aquifer, a natural holding tank. In the third inset photograph at the bottom left, water drips into a rocky pool. A caption reads: Some water moves through tight fractures or pores in the rock layers, taking longer paths to reach the spring’s aquifer. At the top right, a final, color inset photographs shows a view of Grand Canyon Lodge from below, next to an image of a gushing water spigot. A caption reads: Water is tapped at Roaring Springs and pumped to the North and South rims. A D Stop 23, Wayside 2 – On path to Bright Angel Point. ½ minute. Continuing along the asphalt path toward Bright Angel Point, about 60 feet (18 meters) beyond A D stop 22, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the edge of the rim at the right discusses where the air quality in the canyon. A description of this panel, entitled “How’s the View,” is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script How’s the View Wayside Panel Two horizontal, color photographs of the same canyon view split the panel into top and bottom halves. In the top photograph, distant mountain ridges at the left, labeled ‘San Francisco Peaks,’ are visible above the canyon rim. Haze obscures the peaks in the bottom photograph. Words at the top left read: How’s the View? If you are standing here in summer, your view of the San Francisco Peaks is probably hazy. The air pollutants that cause haze can be from local forest fires, but usually they are from distant urban and industrial areas hundreds of miles to the south and west. Because views are so essential to enjoying Grand Canyon, the park has been monitoring visibility since the 1970s. The good news is that the park’s clearest days have gotten clearer in recent years. The bad news is that the haziest days have stayed about the same. An inset map at the top right shows Grand Canyon National Park in the center, with two large, brown arrows pointing up to the canyon from the south. A caption reads: Since most of Grand Canyon’s air pollution comes from distant sources, the National Park Service works with states and tribes to help clear the air there and here. A caption at the bottom right of the top photograph reads: Air pollution affects your canyon experience; the more haze in the air the less vivid Grand Canyon’s colors and forms. A caption at the bottom right of the bottom photograph reads: Pollution-caused haze can get so bad that on some days you can barely see the San Francisco Peaks, 66 miles (106 km) away.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "0", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "5c175f3c-c01a-418f-8171-2cffbfe29b25", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Scenic Overlook, Hiking Trail", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Before you hike, check at the Visitor Center or Backcountry Information Center for water status on the trail - or visit the <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a></strong> webpage - or scen the QR code at the trailhead.<br /> <br /> Even though the Bright Angel Trail has water stations along the trail, carrying your own water is still necessary. Water from natural sources such as creeks and springs should be purified. When hiking in a group, each person should be carrying water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Bright Angel Trail is considered the most popular hiking trail in the park. Well-maintained and graded for stock, it is fairly easy to walk down. This can be a blessing or a curse. Wide views of the inner canyon and distant formations often distract hikers from just how far down the trail they've walked. The return hike back up and out of the canyon is far more difficult and requires much more effort. Plan for at least twice as much time back up as it took to go down.<br /> <br /> While South Kaibab Trail follows a ridge line, Bright Angel Trail is tucked deep within a side canyon along a massive fault, which keeps the trail in this side canyon for the first few miles. The majority of the trail's elevation change takes place in the upper four miles via a series of switchbacks that seem endless. Views are framed by massive cliffs, with more plant and animal life thanks to a higher degree of shade and natural water sources. If you're interested in geology or wildlife, this is a trail with complementary features. You can expect to see mules on the trail as well. See below for more information.<br /> <br /> The trail levels out as it approaches Havasupai Gardens, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and over 2,000 vertical feet (925 meters) below the rim. This destination is an oasis within the canyon, home to the Havasupai People until they were forced to leave when the National Park was established. From here, you might consider the relatively flat (but very exposed) 3-mile (4.8-km) round trip hike to Plateau Point for sunrise or sunset.<br /> <br /> Hikers interested in planning a trip beyond these destinations should consult a park ranger.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> During late fall, winter, and early spring, temperatures regularly drop below freezing, and upper portions of this steep trail can become dangerously icy. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended during these times of year. Consult a park ranger for current trail conditions.<br /> <br /> Before heading down into the canyon, <strong>consult the signs at the trailhead</strong> for trip planning and <strong>current weather, trail information and trail closures</strong>. (or visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a> webpage).<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> Before your hike, it is critical to determine your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>—a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and even death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the directions of the wranglers.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for all camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and how to apply <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online</a></strong>, or talk with a ranger at the Backcountry Information Center, if you are visiting the South Rim.</p> <ul> <li>Only camp in designated campsites - <strong>Havasupai Gardens Campground</strong> offers 15 small group sites and 1 large group site. <br />  </li> <li><strong>CLOSED:</strong> <strong>Bright Angel Campground</strong>, located on the north side of the Colorado River at Phantom Ranch, offers 30 small group sites and 2 large group sites. <strong>On November 1, 2025, Phantom Ranch and Bright Angel Campground are tentatively expected to reopen to the public. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/south-rim-corridor-trails-partially-reopened.htm\">Details</a></strong></li> </ul>", "audioDescription": "At the top left of a vertical wayside panel at the Bright Angel trailhead, a black and red circle surrounds a black-and-white image of Grand Canyon with large white letters urging you to, \"Hike Smart.\" Text reads: \"Welcome to Bright Angel Trail.

Grand Canyon National Park assists more than 600 hikers during the hot summer months and helicopter rescues an additional 150 people...You are responsible for your safety and the safety of your friends and family. Rescue is not a guarantee. Have You Checked the Weather? Summer temperatures in the shade reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) at Indian Garden and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius) at Phantom Ranch. Avoid hiking in the heat of the day, between 10 am and 4pm. In winter, temperatures drop below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) with steep, icy trails requiring shoe traction devices. From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.

The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today.

After purchasing the Bright Angel Hotel on the South Rim, Buggeln partnered with the newly arrived Santa Fe Railroad to provide tourist accommodations.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he became the first postmaster of the Village when he opened a post office in his hotel. As a community gathering place, the post office provided one of the few social outlets for the permanent residents of the developing Village. However, after only a few years in the hotel business, Buggeln sold his interest in Bright Angel Hotel to the Santa Fe Railroad. He had tired of the political infighting between hotel owners, the railroad, and public landholders regarding ownership rights of the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Buggeln bought the 160-acre (65 ha) Hance Ranch property and built a 17-room hotel on the land, although he never operated the hotel for tourists. Instead, he began a cattle operation that continued into the 1930s. Martin Buggeln died in 1939, and in 1948, the National Park Service bought the land from his second wife. At that time, it was the last privately owned property in the park east of Grand Canyon Village. All buildings on the property were removed in 1957.</p>", "audioDescription": "A 4-foot (1.2 m) wide asphalt sidewalk rings the parking lot at Buggeln picnic area. Facing away from the lot, a number of picnic tables are available down a short, steep embankment, nestled among several ponderosa pine and Gambel oak trees. Note there is a unisex vault toilet at the far left-hand side of the lot. Along the path in the middle of the parking lot, a color photograph of a stand of Gambel oak trees fills the left-hand side of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top right reads: \"Welcomed Mix Each ponderosa pine forest is unique. Here at Buggeln picnic area ponderosa pine shares the forest with Gambel oak, resulting in a diverse and rich community of plants and animals. Gambel oak shelters wildlife and attracts higher insect populations. Its acorns and foliage feed golden-mantled ground squirrels, wild turkeys, and common porcupines. Decomposing oak leaves improve soil conditions for grasses, wildflowers, and woody shrubs. Experienced birdwatchers consider these forests hot spots for birds. You man spy uncommon birds here, like Grace's and Virginia's warblers. Pine-oak forests are valuable to native people. For centuries, area tribes have gathered a wide array of foods, medicines, and natural dyes in these productive woods.\" Several inset color photographs across the center of the panel show a dark slate gray Northern goshawk with pale-gray barred underparts, a checkered black-and-white downy woodpecker with a small red patch on the back of its head, a small gray and white Virginia's warbler, and a black wild turkey with a red wattle. Other photographs show the small red and yellow flowers of the wax currant, and the small greenish-white to pink flower clusters of the snowberry. Text at the bottom left of the panel reads: \"Gambel oak often associates with ponderosa pine at elevations of 6,000-8,000 feet (1,800-2,400 m). Fires visit this forest every 5 to 7 years. Low-intensity ground fires cycle nutrients into the soil to help this forest combination thrive.\" Next to a picture of a mountain lion at the bottom right, a caption reads: \"Feeding wildlife upsets the balance of this natural forest community.

A copper wire runs across the top of the crossbar. An old black-and-white picture in the center of a nearby three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel shows a man perched atop a similar, taller steel pole steadied by a second man on the ground. Text at the left reads: \"CCC Legacy. The nearby plaque commemorates an amazing feat achieved by members of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) in the 1930s - construction of a telephone line spanning the entire width of Grand Canyon. One of the poles still stands behind this wall. Beginning in 1934, CCC enrollees worked through winter snow and summer heat to survey and clear a right-of-way roughly following the Bright Angel and North Kaibab trails. Supplied by pack mules, they set 592 galvanized pipe telephone poles and completed stringing the 18 miles (29 km) of copper-weld wire in 1935.\" A quote from Robert L. Robeson, a CCC Enrollee, at the top right of the panel reads: \"Maybe those mountains are hard to climb. Those trees so hard to cut. But the air is pure, the water fine. And we're climbing right out of the rut...For besides helping ourselves, you see. We are helping Mother and Dad.\" Two additional black-and-white pictures inset at the right of the panel show workers building the stone wall before you, and a line of flat-bed trucks filled with young men. A caption reads: \"At Grand Canyon, today's visitors still benefit from the labor and skills of seven CCC companies.

The parking lot for Cape Royal is located about one and a half miles (two point four kilometers) south of Walhalla Overlook, at the end of Cape Royal Road. Note an accessible parking area along the left (east) side of the multi-lane lot. Also note a wheelchair accessible vault toilet along the north side of the lot. Beside the accessible parking spaces, the paved, six-foot wide Cape Royal Trail leads east towards the rim, flanked by two wildlife-proof, metal garbage containers. The flat, paved trail, lined with stones on either side, leads about four-tenths of a mile (650 meters) to the point at Cape Royal. Note a wide variety of plants and trees growing along the sides of the trail. Pinyon pine is recognized by its short needles which typically grow in bundles of twos; cliffrose by its cream-colored blossoms and sweet fragrance throughout the summer; Utah Juniper trees by their scraggly bare trunks and bluish berries; and sagebrush with small blue-gray leaves with a strong sage aroma. Moving along the trail, the natural arch of Angel's Window to your left (east) frames the sweeping turn of the Colorado River at the Unkar Delta. About halfway along the path, a smaller paved path to the left leads to a trail along the top of Angel’s Window. About 150 feet (45 meters) before reaching the point at Cape Royal, a three-foot wide paved trail leads left (east) down a slight slope to a rocky overlook. Note at the end of this short trail, two uneven stone steps lead down onto a wide, open area with loose dirt and rocks. Moving east, a series of uneven, rocky ledges step down to an overlook at the rim. Note there are no guardrails or railings here. Continuing south along the main path, at the top of the point overlook area, the pavement forks in two around some boulders in the middle of the path. About 35 feet (10 meters) forward, the paths converge, sloping gently downward. The path forks again around more boulders in the middle, leading about 60 feet (18 meters) south to a roughly 15 foot (five meter) wide curved, paved overlook area at the point. Metal railings line the rim along the second path and the whole overlook area. Stunning bands of color, deep gorges, and towering buttes are revealed. Situated one mile immediately to the southwest, the wooded top of Wotans Throne, composed of thick limestone over top a layer of cream-colored, cliff-forming sandstone, rises 5,200 feet (1,585 meters) above the Colorado River, over 7,700 feet (2,300 meters) above sea level. About two miles (three point two kilometers) east-southeast of Wotans Throne is Vishnu Temple. Also composed of cream-colored, cliff-forming sandstone with a limestone cupola caprock, it rises over just over 7,500 feet (nearly 2,300 meters) high. Three wayside panels along the rails at the rim discuss the differences in water erosion on the north versus the south rim, how the impressive Vishnu Temple and Wotan’s Throne rock temples located here were formed, and how cold air can trap haze layers in the canyon. Descriptions of these three wayside panels are included in the sub-script below. Back in the parking area, note at the west side of the lot, a second path leads south to a picnic area, and a separate wedding site on the edge of the rim. Also flanked by two wildlife-proof, metal garbage containers, a gravel and dirt path leads to a small grove of trees with a number of picnic tables overlooking the canyon. From the grove, the path continues to the right to an open area surrounded by pinyon pine trees. Two rows of half-log wooden benches face a rock altar at the rim’s edge. Note a permit is required to use the wedding site. North versus South Wayside Panel An aerial photograph of the canyon fills the face of a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. Entitled “North versus South,” a yellow inset illustration at the top right shows the changing depth of the canyon in profile, with the Colorado River identified at its lowest point towards the left. Text reads: The slicing power of the Colorado River has given Grand Canyon its depth (1 mile, 1.6 km), while side stream erosion has given the canyon its width. Water is the single most powerful force acting on the canyon today. This is especially apparent on the North Rim, where the landscape is a maze of jutting side canyons, rock islands, and horseshoe-shaped alcoves. The North Rim has eroded more than 7 miles (11 km) from the river’s edge, while the South Rim has only retreated 3 miles (5 km). Why? Because the North Rim is higher than the South Rim by 1,200 feet (366 m) and captures twice the amount of rain and snow. Since the plateaus are higher to the north, water from the North Rim runs south into the canyon, causing greater side canyon incisions. Water on the South Rim runs south too, away from the canyon, resulting in less erosion and a steeper profile. At the lower left, a black label with the words, “You Are Here,” points to your location here at Cape Royal on the North Rim, directly opposite Grandview on the South Rim, with the Colorado River snaking between them in the center. Text at the lower right states: The North Rim receives up to 12 feet (4 m) of snow each winter, while the South Rim gets about 5 feet (1.5 m) of annual snowfall. Building Temples Wayside Panel A color photograph of two of the most stunning formations visible from Cape Royal fills the bottom of a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail: the Vishnu Temple formation beside Wotan’s Throne. Text at the top left of the panel reads: Building Temples At first glance the canyon resembles ancient temples towering above the river. Geologist Clarence Dutton named many of the canyon’s formations temples, after Eastern religious and spiritual deities like Shiva and Vishnu. Cliffs, slopes, alcoves, plateaus, mesas, buttes, terraces, and platforms all make up what we call temples in Grand Canyon. Temples form when side canyon erosion produces peninsula-like projections off the main rims, like here on Cape Royal. Further erosion transforms the peninsulas into islands, like Wotan’s Throne, and separates them from the rim, like Vishnu Temple. Erosion continues, as softer rock erodes and undercuts harder rock, until the temple is gone. At the top right, a series of three, inset illustrations show how temples are constructed. In the first illustration, a peninsula-like projection of rock juts out from the canyon rim due to side canyon erosion. The second illustration shows that peninsula beginning to detach from the rim. A caption reads, “With continued erosion, the peninsulas become islands, separated from the rims.” In the third illustration, the ‘island’ becomes narrower and more distinct. A third caption reads, “Temple erosion continues as softer rock, which erodes easier and faster, undercuts harder rock, leaving the hard rock without support and causing it to break and fall. The sequence continues until the temple has vanished.” At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of a roughly square stone temple topped with crumbling, triangular rocks. Text reads: Ancient Temples Looking at this Vishnu Temple built 1,500 years ago in India, can you see why geologist Clarence Dutton thought fitting to name canyon formations temples? Can you find Grand Canyon’s Vishnu Temple in the view? Which Vishnu Temple is older? Trapped in the Canyon Wayside Panel A crisp panoramic color photograph of the canyon fills the face of a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. Text at the top left reads: Trapped in the Canyon Grand Canyon National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior Your view from Cape Royal extends across the canyon and may reach 100 miles (160 km) on a clear day. Sometimes, however, the view within the canyon is hidden or murky. Why? When the winds are calm, cold air can drain into the canyon and become trapped. If moisture in the cold air is high enough, clouds may form in the canyon, with only the rims and highest temples poking through. Less appealing are the times when the cold air carries air pollution into the canyon from nearby industries or forest fires. Fire managers try to avoid such smoke impacts, but sometimes it happens. Human industry tries to lessen their impacts too. One nearby coal-fired power plant invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce its contribution to these haze layers that get trapped in the canyon.

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "dfa9d906-d683-4ae1-a193-d1beb0f6c3c5", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Trail ", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

There are guardrails around the cliff edge for your safety.<br /> <br /> Directly below is the Colorado River's \"Big Bend\", where it dramatically shifts its previously southward course by executing a sharp 90-degree turn to the west, cutting directly into a major uplift on the Colorado Plateau known as the Kaibab Upwarp. Looking to the west, one can glimpse in the distance where the river plunges into the black, narrow, confined depths of the Granite Gorge.The airline distance to the opposite rim of the canyon is 18 miles; to the Colorado River, 4 miles. The river is about 300 feet wide as seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> To the east, several thousand feet below where you are now standing, is the broad expanse of a plateau known as the Marble Platform, which is part of the Navajo Nation. The brilliant colors of the Painted Desert can be glimpsed in the distance. <br /> <br /> Also to the east, and situated back from the Canyon rim, is a prominent flat-topped mesa called Cedar Mountain. Just beyond this mountain the Little Colorado River gorge extends north and south as a crack in the surface of the earth. Tracing the gorge to the left, one may see where it connects with Grand Canyon. The point of connection is where Grand Canyon begins. From that point the Canyon extends 217 miles westward as measured by the Colorado River. Fifty miles of the canyon may be seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> Dark cliffs bordering the Colorado River below Desert View are composed of lavas resulting from volcanic activity long before the cutting of Grand Canyon began. For the most part the walls of Grand Canyon consist of material which hardened into rock after being deposited by wind or water: Consequently, this lava rock is very different in origin and character from the rest of the rocks of the Canyon walls.</p> <h3>1956 Aviation Accident Memorial</h3> <p>At Desert View point, a National Historic Landmark plaque and stone memorial commemorate the 1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site,<strong> </strong>a horrific airline collision over Grand Canyon that took place on June 30, 1956. <br /> <br /> On that day, a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Super Constellation L-1049 and a United Airlines DC-7 collided in uncongested airspace 21,000 feet over the Grand Canyon, and killing all 128 people onboard the two flights. The tragedy spurred an unprecedented effort to modernize and increase safety in America’s postwar airways, culminating in the establishment of the modern Federal Aviation Administration. </p> <h3>National Historic Landmarks Program</h3> <p>The National Historic Landmarks Program, established in 1935, is administered by the National Park Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The agency works with preservation officials, private property owners, and other partners interested in nominating properties for National Historic Landmark designation. Completed nominations are reviewed by the National Park System Advisory Board, which makes recommendations for designation to the Secretary of the Interior. This site was dedicated as one of the nation's newest National Historic Landmarks on Tuesday, July 8, 2014.</p>", "audioDescription": "At an overlook area at the very northern tip of Desert View Point at Desert View Watchtower, an 18-inch (46 cm) square, metal plaque, embedded in a four-foot (1.2 m) tall by roughly two-foot (60 cm) wide limestone pillar reads: “1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This tragic accident site represents a watershed moment in the modernization of America's airways leading to the establishment of the Federal Aviation Administration and national standards for aviation safety. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America. 2014, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior.\" Nearby, a panoramic photograph of the canyon at this location fills a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the right reads: \"Tragedy Remembered—Catastrophe can happen even in spectacular beauty. When technological achievements and human actions fail, disasters may happen. On June 30, 1956, a United Airlines DC-7 and TWA Super Constellation maneuvered around towering cumulus clouds on a partly clear day. All 128 passengers and crew perished when the planes collided at an altitude of 21,000 feet (6,400 m) above Temple and Chuar buttes. Passengers included prominent businesspeople and families. Every passenger had loved ones waiting for them, though their journey ended unexpectedly. The Grand Canyon disaster \"rocked the aviation world.\" It was the deadliest crash in American commercial aviation history at the time. Within a few years, the United States Congress created the Federal Aviation Administration to increase air safety. Due to its importance in aviation history, this hallowed ground is a National Historic Landmark. This designates and protects artifacts remaining in this remote area of the canyon and provides learning opportunities from that day and beyond.\" Two inset pictures at the bottom show additional monuments commemorating the crash with the text: \"Grand Canyon's Pioneer Cemetery (L) is the final resting place for 29 unidentified passengers from United Airlines. Recovery personnel removed the remains of the 70 accident victims from the TWA flight, and all but three were interred in a mass grave at Flagstaff Citizens Cemetery (R). Twenty-nine identified passengers were returned home for burial.

From there, the Watchtower is in plain view.<br /> <br /> Recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the Watchtower was constructed in 1932. Architect Mary Colter’s design takes its influences from the architecture of the Ancestral Puebloan people of the Colorado Plateau. This particular tower was patterned after those found at Hovenweep and the Round Tower of Mesa Verde. Colter indicated that it was not a copy of any that she had seen, but rather modeled from several.<br /> <br /> The view from the Watchtower provides a unique perspective of the eastern portion of Grand Canyon. From here, looking to the northeast offers a distant glimpse of the Colorado River's transition from the relatively narrow Marble Canyon to the north into the much wider, broader expanse of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> For more about what can be seen from here, view <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-point-1956-aviation-accident-memorial.htm\">Desert View Point.</a></p> <h3>The View Room</h3> <p>This lower floor of the tower, the View Room, is modeled after a traditional Native American kiva, and hosts cultural demonstrations by indigenous artists during spring, summer and fall. A Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store is also located here.<br /> <br /> Inside the Watchtower View Room, views of the canyon, through the different windows, are enhanced by looking through reflectoscopes —viewing instruments that use polished black glass mirrors to cut through the haze and glare of bright sunlight and more clearly highlight the canyon's multi-colored layers.<br /> <br /> The View Room, which for years was used as retail space, in 2015 was returned to the open area that Mary Colter had intended, because the room was originally designed to be a rest area. It was here that visitors to the canyon in the 1930’s could sit in comfort and have outstanding views of the canyon. The fireplace is unique in that it does not block the view for visitors. Gaze into one of the reflectoscopes and see a different perspective of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More About the Watchtower</h3> <p>With painstaking detail, Colter directed the placement of each rock and architectural accent in the Desert View Watchtower. Using mostly locally sourced rocks and reused timber, the tower appears to grow organically from the rim of the canyon itself, paying homage to the techniques and styles of local tribes while utilizing modern-day equipment and materials to strengthen the internal structure. <br /> <br /> As you approach the building you might see how well it blends into the environment. It is difficult to tell where the rock of the canyon walls end, and the tower begins. Colter said:<br /> <br /> <em>“First and most important, was to design a building that would become part of its surroundings; one that would create no discordant note against the time eroded walls of this promontory.”</em><br /> <br /> To obtain this result she insisted that the rocks not be cut or worked, so they would not lose the <em>“weathered surfaces so essential to blend it with the canyon walls”.</em><br /> <br /> Note, too, some of the intricate designs she had built into the tower. For example, look for the white decorative stones near the top, which fade out as the eye goes around the tower. She had seen this pattern at Chaco Canyon and thought it would break the monotony of this Watchtower. The built in cracks which are patterned from some of the ancient towers she had seen are deliberately designed. There are petroglyphs on some of the stones. Can you spot them?<br /> <br /> The internal steel framework of the Watchtower was designed and supervised by the bridge builders of the Santa Fe Railway company. Upon this framework, each exterior stone was selected and carefully placed to ensure exactly the look that Mary Colter was hoping to obtain.</p> <h3>Traveling to the Watchtower </h3> <p><strong>Park Shuttles are NOT provided to Desert View. You must drive you vehicle, or take a </strong><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/plan/interpretive-bus-tours/\">commercial bus tour</a>, that starts from Grand Canyon Village.<br /> <br /> The 23 mile (37 km) drive east of Grand Canyon Village on Arizona Highway 64 is worth the effort. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-drive.htm\">Desert View Drive</a> offers spectacular perspectives of the canyon, including: </p> <ul> <li>Six developed canyon viewpoints</li> <li>Four picnic areas </li> <li>Five unmarked pullouts </li> <li>Accessibility for private vehicles </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/tusayan-ruin-trail.htm\">Tusayan Pueblo Site and Museum</a> - Open Thursday through Monday</li> </ul> <p><br /> There is NO lodging at Desert View, although there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-campground.htm\">seasonal campground</a> operated by the National Park Service from mid-April to mid-October.</p> <h3>Desert View Visitor Services</h3> <p>Desert View provides restrooms, the Watchtower, Trading Post/ice cream/coffee, Grocery Store/Deli, Gas Station, and Campground. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view.htm\">Details ></a><br /> <br /> <strong>Cultural handicraft demonstrations take place in the Watchtower in the Spring, Summer and Fall. </strong>The program provides an opportunity for visitors to interact with Tribal artisans from Grand Canyon's Traditionally Associated Tribes, and for them to share their history, knowledge and skills. <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-cultural-demonstration-program.htm\">View the Schedule ></a></em></p>", "audioDescription": "As you move north down a gently sloping eight-foot-wide asphalt path, a five-story, 70-foot-tall (21 m) circular stone tower sits perched on the South Rim at the left. Massive, irregularly shaped limestone foundation stones ring the bottom of its 30-foot (9 m) diameter base. Concentric rows of rough rectangular-shaped limestone bricks with weathered faces fill its tapered sides. Log posts stick out through the wall here and there. Trapezoidal-shaped picture windows appear near the top of the tower. Cracks in the walls seem to run through many smaller window openings irregularly disposed along its surface, some of which are themselves irregular in shape, all conveying a partly ruinous appearance. Inlaid in one side is a three-foot (1 m) square limestone plaque of a native snake spirit, and there is open observation area on the roof. Immediately west of the Watchtower, but separated from it by several feet, stands a stone ruin which serves as a storage facility and firewood bin. To the right is an attached one-story, 40-foot (12 m) diameter circular stone kiva, with an observation platform on its roof and large picture windows overlooking the canyon. Magnificent vistas of earth and sky are visible from the many overlooks in, on, and around the tower. Colors blend and change as the sun rises and passes toward the west. The dark night sky allows stars to slowly emerge. Feel the extreme texture in the masonry, and the careful massing of forms that add visual depth and architectural emphasis to the structure. Listen to the winds and canyon creatures all around you. Move from the asphalt sidewalk through a wood-framed doorway and into the stone kiva building onto a flat stone floor. Opposite the door on the far side of the 40-foot (12 m) diameter circular room is a six-foot (2 m) wide stone fireplace. In the center is a smaller four-foot (1.2 m) wide symbolic fire ring, two-feet (60 cm) tall, topped with a ladder to the world above. Visitors are not permitted to climb the ladder. Six eight-foot (2.4 m) wide by six-foot (2 m) tall windows ring the perimeter of the room looking out onto the canyon. Note that the 18-inch (46 cm) deep stone windowsills also serve as seating areas and benches. Notice also that along the side of some of the large windows hang three-foot (1 m) wide by four-foot (1.5 m) tall black reflector scopes in wood log frames. Originally made of highly polished black onyx, they were invented by Claude Lorrain in the 1600s to intensify the color of the image reflected in the scope that gets wiped out by very strong light. Reflecting Grand Canyon's image in the black glass makes the color seem stronger. Above the windows, logs salvaged from the old Grandview Hotel are overlaid horizontally six-feet high in a crisscrossing, cribbed formation around the circular room. Additional horizontal logs form the flat ceiling of the room. Fifteen feet (4.5 m) to the left of the door is a small Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store. Facing the store, 10 feet (3 m) to the right, a stone staircase with a leather-wrapped wooden handrail on the right curves counterclockwise up 22 steps to the first floor of the Watchtower. Note a four-foot (1.2 m) long by four-foot (1.2 m) tall metal handrail mounted to the floor at the base of the stairs that serves to separate foot traffic flowing simultaneously up and down the stairs. Note also a doorway to the left at the top of the stairs that leads out onto the flat roof and observation deck of the circular kiva building.", "isPassportStampLocation": "1", "passportStampLocationDescription": "Desert View Watchtower has its own unique, official, dated passport cancellation stamp which reads \"Desert View Watchtower\" at the bottom.

Try to describe the canyon's size in words. Try to measure in your mind the canyon's depth, width, and length. Measurements like 1 mile (1.6 km) deep, 18 miles (29 km) wide, and 277 river miles (446 km) long leave us scratching our heads. Perhaps the best we can do is just feel the canyon's enormity. Measure yourself up against it. We are minuscule in comparison, but still, through the keen receptivity of our sense, we can appreciate Grand Canyon's immensity. A second aerial photograph inset at the bottom right shows an even wider view of Grand Canyon. The branch-like arms of the inner smaller canyons extend from the snaky path of the Colorado River.

Initially owned and operated by the Fred Harvey company in conjunction with the Santa Fe Railway, many considered it the most elegant hotel west of the Mississippi River.<br /> <br /> In 1987, the hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark.</p>", "audioDescription": "Located on Village Loop Drive about 100 feet (30 m) from the South Rim, the El Tovar Hotel blends a Swiss chalet and a Norwegian hunting lodge with a rustic Mission style. Five steps lead up to a broad limestone and pine entry veranda on its east side, extending 40 feet (12 m) across the front of the building. Numerous rocking chairs and benches are set out on its 10-foot (3 m) deep wooden porch. Behind the veranda, the lobby rises three stories tall, topped with an octagonal turret with a pyramid roof. A smaller wooden porch on the north side of the building faces the canyon, and is equipped with a wheelchair ramp. The hotel has many levels. The 200-foot (60 m) long two-story central portion runs roughly parallel with the canyon rim and connects to three-story north and south wings. The top floors of the guest room wings extend only partway from the central section, creating roof decks. The third floor exterior is treated as a mansard, with projecting dormers with shallow gables. The lower portions of the building are mainly of log construction, yielding to a lighter, smoother framed construction sheathed with dark wood planking on the upper levels. The roof is covered in wood shingles. Inside, the central rotunda of the lobby features Swiss-inspired cutout wood railings framed by peeled log posts, all varnished a dark brown. Southwestern pattern carpets are accented with Arts and Crafts Movement furnishings and native southwestern motifs. There are two gift stores at the left and right, and numerous mounted moose, deer, and elk heads ring the room high on the walls under exposed log timbers. Accessible restrooms are located down a hallway to the right of the check-in desk in the center of the rotunda. Keys to these facilities may be requested at the desk.To the rear of the lobby is a dining room with large windows through which one can view the canyon.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/el-tovar-hotel/", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "a4cbf2cc-c797-4a1c-84bb-60bee8853b32", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Accessible Rooms", "ATM/Cash Machine", "Audio Description", "Automated Entrance", "Automated External Defibrillator (AED)", "Fire Extinguisher", "Food/Drink - Bar/Alcohol For Sale", "Food/Drink - Cafeteria", "Food/Drink - Coffee", "Food/Drink - Restaurant/Table Service", "Food/Drink - Snacks", "Food/Drink - Vending Machine/Self Service", "Gifts/Souvenirs/Books", "Information", "Restroom", "Telephone", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "Grand Canyon Lodges (Xanterra)", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Grand Canyon Village", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "E32D2136-A184-4C1A-91D2-4C20CEF9CBAF", "value": "National Historic Landmark", "name": "Designation"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

A GCC membership provides you with a 15% discount on all purchases at any of GCC bookstores in the park.

As a park ranger working on the South Rim, McKee saw the need for a partnership to support interpretive programs, publications, and efforts to preserve the canyon. From its beginning, the natural history association did just that, funding interpretive talks, research, and scientific papers. It continues to do so today as the Grand Canyon Conservancy.<br /> <br /> Today, GCC still serves its founding mission, and much more. Membership, general-audience publications, educational outreach, a field institute, and philanthropy programs were added over the years to serve the Conservancy's mission of cultivating support, education, and understanding of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More Information (Wi-Fi or cell service required)</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\">Grand Canyon Conservancy</a></p>", "audioDescription": "No public services.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "0", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": [], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "South Rim Village", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "E32D2136-A184-4C1A-91D2-4C20CEF9CBAF", "value": "National Historic Landmark", "name": "Designation"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

The North Rim Visitor Center is located about 400 feet (120 meters) north of Grand Canyon Lodge along the east side of the road, at the far south end of the main lodge parking lot. Note there are two sections of several wheelchair accessible parking spaces along the bottom of this lot. This stop begins behind the Visitor Center. From a position facing south from the south end of the parking lot, straight ahead, a roughly 30 foot (nine meter) square concrete plaza fills the area in back of the Visitor Center building, off to the right. About 15 feet (four and a half meters) ahead at the left stands a 10 foot (three meter) tall stone wayside structure with open sides and a triangular log and shingle roof. About five feet (one and a half meters) in front of the short, north wall of the stone structure at the left, a green, metal, standalone entrance permit self-pay station stands mounted to the ground. At the top center, a central L C D screen allows one to select from one of four vehicle pass options. A note to the left of the screen lists a telephone number for assistance purchasing a pass: 9 2 8, 6 3 8, 7 8 5 0. Inside the stone structure, several large information panels about the park’s trails and overlooks are displayed, including several maps of the region. A description of these panels is included in the sub-script below. About six feet (two meters) to the right of the far end of the wayside structure, note a water bottle filling station atop a low, rectangular stone base with three spigots across its face. To the right of the water station, two 12-foot (three and a half meter) tall square, stone pillars support the back log and shingle roof of the Visitor Center. They frame a wide walkway to a set of restrooms inside through a pair of double, wood and glass doors. Note the men’s restroom is to the left, and the women’s accessible restroom is to the right. Also note a wooden bench along the walkway to the right, and a single wooden chair to the left. Embedded in the middle of the plaza, between the wayside structure and Visitor Center building, a compass rose surrounds a central brass medallion with the words, “Grand Canyon National Park North Rim” around its edge in all capital letters. The center of the medallion lists several statistics. It reads: Elevation above sea: 8,238 feet (2,511 meters) D M S (N A D 83): 36 degrees, 11 minutes, 54 seconds North; 112 degrees, three minutes, eight seconds West U T M (N A D 83 Zone 12 N): 4 0 5 3 9 2 E, 4 0 0 6 4 6 8 N At the far northeast end of the plaza, a small, standalone, wood plank hut with an open front houses a coin-operated soda machine at the left, and an ice machine along the back wall. To move to the Visitor Center entrance, once again from a position located at the south end of the main parking lot, turn right (east) toward the lodge loop road, and move forward about 35 feet (10 meters) down a slightly sloping sidewalk along the side of the building. Note a pair of metal, wildlife-proof garbage cans to the right back towards the lot. Just past a couple, two-tier wooden benches at the right, the sidewalk narrows, bounded by low stone boulders at the right. A few more feet forward, the sidewalk turns left to face up an inclined ramp with a log fence and railing on either side. Continue about 20 feet (six meters) up the ramp to a 15 foot wide by 10 foot deep (four and a half by three meter) wood plank porch at the front of the Visitor Center. You may enter the Visitor Center through a pair of wood and glass doors in the center of the porch at the left. On the porch to the left and right of the front doors, two, three-foot tall, angled, wooden wayside panels display information about North Rim Park Ranger programs and park announcements. Note there is a wooden bench on the far side of the porch opposite the ramp. Also note across the porch, directly opposite the front doors, a wide flight of 10 concrete stairs with a log railing on either side lead down to a sidewalk in front the Visitor Center, beside the two-lane lodge loop road. The Visitor Center houses the Grand Canyon Conservancy bookstore. It features a wide variety of books, maps, and gifts to help you plan or remember your trip to Grand Canyon, and to learn more about its geology, ecology, and history. Sub-Script Welcome Wayside Panel About five feet (one and a half meters) in front of the short, north wall of the tall stone wayside structure, a green, metal, standalone entrance permit self-pay station stands mounted to the ground. Behind the pay station, words at the top of an information panel mounted to the face of the stone wayside structure read, “Welcome to Grand Canyon’s North Rim.” A color photograph filling the bottom half of the panel shows a view of a Grand Canyon sunset at Bright Angel Point. At the center left of the panel, the first of two inset color images shows a photograph of the front porch of the Visitor Center. A list of the amenities and their icons below the photograph reads: Information and Orientation; Water; Restrooms; and Access to Grand Canyon rim and lodge. The second image at the center right shows a map of the roads around the North Rim, traced in black. The roads generally run along the top of the map, from the lodge and campground areas at the left, up and across the Kaibab and Walhalla Plateaus to the right to Point Imperial, Vista Encantada, Roosevelt Point, all the way to Cape Royal at the lower right. At the left of the image, a small, rectangular “You Are Here” label sits below another label identifying the Visitor Center. Exploring the Region Wayside Panel On the inside face of the short, north, front stone wall of the wayside structure, an information panel presents a half dozen color photographs at the top and bottom of other, nearby national parks, monuments, and recreational areas. In the center of the panel is a map identifying their locations relative to Grand Canyon National Park, shown in the center of the map. From left to right at the top, there is an image of a conical, thatched hut from Pipe Spring National Monument in Arizona, the high, vertical cliff walls of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, and the dam and river below the high, curved stone walls of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona and Utah. From left to right at the bottom, there is an image of tall, stone buttresses with flat, stone tops at Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, three isolated, tall stone buttes in Monument Valley Tribal Park in Arizona and Utah, and the rim of the steep, deep canyon at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. Many other sites are also shown on the map. Explore Close By Wayside Panel Sheltered in the center of the stone wayside structure, two five-foot wide by three-foot tall (one and a half by one meter) information panels mounted on angled, metal reading rails stand back-to-back. From a position facing east, with the short, north stone wall and the “Exploring the Region” wayside at the left, a color photograph at the top left of this panel shows a canyon view along Bright Angel Trail, framed by a rocky overhang above, and a couple scraggly evergreens at the left. Text beneath the photograph reads: Explore Close By Experience the North Rim: walks along the rim, down into the canyon, and through high forests. Feel the remoteness of this high vantage point. These hikes are only a short walk of drive away. For information about more hikes, drives, and overlooks – see the other side. At the bottom left, a caption below an inset image of a small newspaper reads: The park newspaper, The Guide, contains detailed information about hikes. Available at the visitor center in Deutsch, Español, Francais, Italiano, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. A map of the immediate North Rim area fills the middle of the panel. A dark line traces the outline of the rim, a long, slender, peninsula-like shape, like Italy without the heel of the boot. At the lower left, a legend above a compass rose shows the symbols used for the roads, sidewalks, trails, and buildings on the map. Towards the bottom center, in a cluster of buildings around Grand Canyon Lodge, a couple small, rectangular labels point to the Visitor Center with the words, “You Are Here.” In the center of the map is the campground, with the North Kaibab trailhead near the top. Small, numbered circles appear along four of the dotted line trails, corresponding to a photograph and short description of each trail on the right side of the panel. At the top right of the panel, the first of three descriptions shows a photograph of the canyon along the Bright Angel fault. A title reads: 1 – Bright Angel Point Trail – Easy A caption continues: Walk the short trail from the lodge to a dramatic canyon overlook. Zero point five miles (zero point eight kilometers) roundtrip 30 minute roundtrip The second of three descriptions shows a photograph of a packed dirt path winding through a stand of tall ponderosa pine. A title reads: 2 – Bridle Path – Easy A caption continues: Hike through ponderosa forests to the North Kaibab Trailhead. Two point four miles (three point nine kilometers) roundtrip. One point five hours roundtrip. Bicycles and leashed pets allowed. The third descriptions shows a photograph of a wide dirt and gravel path lined with large boulders beside a mixed evergreen and deciduous forest.

About 400 feet (120 meters) south of the Visitor Center, Route 67 reaches its southernmost end in a loop road that runs in front of a U-shaped, multiple log and stone building complex. Note a ‘Do Not Enter’ sign at the head of the loop road, as access is restricted to authorized commercial service providers, and folks entering to use the accessible parking spaces along the east near Rough Rider Saloon. Here we find Deli in the Pines to the west, Grand Canyon Lodge to the south, and Rough Rider Saloon, the Post Office, and the gift shop along the east. A stone sidewalk porch at ground level runs in front of Deli in the Pines and Grand Canyon Lodge. Note also a raised stone sidewalk porch in front the gift shop, Post Office, and Rough Rider Saloon. This porch can be accessed from a set of stone stairs at the north and south ends of the porch, or via an access ramp that begins just north of the gift shop at ground level. From here, the ramp leads about 60 feet (18 meters) east up a slight incline, then turns right to continue 100 feet (30 meters) south along the back of the building. Turning right again, the ramp continues up a slight incline with metal handrails at the left and center, then through a covered, stone hallway to arrive at the south end of the raised sidewalk porch, with Rough Rider Saloon at the right. The loop road surrounds an oval landscaped area in its center. Towards the southern end of the oval, a metal flagpole stands before a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. A rough, stone sidewalk spans the 40 foot (12 meter) width of the oval in front of the wayside. Should you move to the wayside, be mindful of any vehicular traffic when crossing the loop road. Entitled, “Grand Canyon Lodge,” the panel tells of the need for and construction of the lodge. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. A wide, covered, flat stone sidewalk porch runs around the front of all the buildings, supported by large stone columns and wide wooden posts, spaced about every eight to ten feet (two-and-a-half to three meters) along the roofline at the edge of the sidewalk. Beginning at the far, northwest side of the complex, a set of restrooms is located up a couple wide, stone steps from the loop road, through a single wooden door. The men’s restroom is to the left; the women’s restroom is to the right. From the restrooms, move about 50 feet (15 meters) south along the porch to the two side-by-side glass and metal doors of Deli in the Pines at the right. Coffee drinks are available daily, in addition to grab-and-go sandwiches, pizza, soup or chili, and snacks. Grab-and-go food menu items and beverages are available daily. Note there may be a two-tier wooden bench outside the deli doors at the edge of the sidewalk. From Deli in the Pines, continue south along the porch another 40 feet (12 meters), then turn left about 50 feet (15 meters) to the main entrance to Grand Canyon Lodge at the right. To the right of the doors, note a water fountain with a bottle filling spigot mounted on the outside wall of the lodge. Also note a wildlife-proof, metal garbage on the other side of the porch, immediately opposite the water fountain. The lodge features private cabins, both along and near the rim of Grand Canyon in the forest. Interior wheelchair lifts allow access to the auditorium and dining room. The dining room serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. Note reservations are required for dinner. At the back of the lodge, two large, stone patios with wooden deck chairs afford unobstructed views of the canyon. A third interior wheelchair lift allows access to the patio level. Note also several narrow, uneven stone staircases and paths that lead down from the patio to the Bright Angel Point Trail along the base of the lodge. From the front doors of the lodge, the porch continues about 50 feet (15 meters) east past a long line of large, rough-hewn, wooden deck chairs placed along the outside stone wall at the right. A 15-foot (three meter) wide stone staircase, with a metal handrail at each side and another in the middle, leads up nine steps to the stone porch area in front of Rough Rider Saloon. Whether you arrive at this location via the stairs or the access ramp, here at the southern end of the stone porch, white, arched lettering across the top of a six-foot (two meter) square plate glass window spells, “Saloon.” Guests are invited to stop in for a quick cappuccino, espresso, or coffee in the morning. Baked goods and breakfast burritos are also available from 5:30 to 10:30 am. In the afternoon, from 11 am to 11 pm, cold beverages and pizza slices are available while the saloon transitions to evening dinner options and a bar. About six feet (two meters) north along the porch from the saloon is the Post Office. Vertical metal bars cover the face of a double-hung window in the log wall, with a small open slot at the bottom center. At the top left side of the window, white letters carved into the first of two, small wooden signs sticking out from the building read, “Post Office.” The second reads, “N Rim A Z, 8 6 0 5 2.” Beneath the window, a word above a horizontal slot at the top of a plain, painted, brown wooden panel reads, “Letters.” About six feet (two meters) to the left (north) of the window, note a sturdy, three foot (one meter) tall wooden writing desk juts out from the wall about two feet (60 centimeters). A second, narrow wooden shelf is mounted to the wall slightly above it. Note also a garbage can on the porch, placed just to the left of the desk. The Post Office is an active operation that handles post cards and letters for residents and visitors to Grand Canyon's North Rim. It is open Monday through Friday during the season between the hours of 8 am and 12 pm, and from 1 pm to 5 pm At the far northern end of the raised, stone porch is the door to the gift shop. The shop offers visitors to the North Rim gifts, postcards, and souvenirs of their trip, from clothing and accessories to Native Americans handicrafts. Sub-Script Grand Canyon Lodge Wayside Panel A sepia-tone photograph fills the left side of the panel. In front a line of buses arrayed in front of Grand Canyon Lodge, a line of men and women stand a couple rows deep, all dressed in light-colored, one-piece dresses or white shirts with dark pants. Two of the men hold a banjo and guitar. A caption reads: Lodge employees, in 1930, “sing away” departing guests in front of the first Grand Canyon Lodge. Entitled, “Grand Canyon Lodge,” text at the top of the panel reads: When Grand Canyon became a national park in 1919, the North Rim was scarcely developed. While the South Rim had grand hotels and many visitor programs and services, the hard-to-reach North Rim had only rustic tent cabins for 40 guests. The National Park Service’s first Director, Stephen T. Mather, urged the Union Pacific Railroad to improve access to the North Rim and build a rustic lodge with cabins. During 1927–1928, architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed and built a lodge using local Kaibab Limestone and ponderosa pine logs taken from the site. Just four years after completion, the new lodge and four cabins burned to the ground. At the top right, a caption above a color inset drawing of the lodge reads: Architect Underwood’s rendering of the original lodge shows its second story level and a three-story observation tower, both eliminated in the lodge’s reconstruction in 1937. A quote above the rendering reads: So cunningly have the architects planned this remarkable building that it seems to have sprung full-grown from the canyon wall itself. —Union Pacific Railroad, 1929 At the bottom right, a black-and-white picture shows a roofless, burned-out lodge, with blackened stone walls. A caption reads: On September 1, 1932, fire left only the foundations and walls of the first lodge. The present-day lodge, rebuilt on the old foundation, features more stone and less timber to make it more fire resistant. The steeper roof sheds snow more efficiently.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "https://www.grandcanyonnorth.com/", "isOpenToPublic": "0", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "fd93931a-bdb0-4601-92b2-9a0f05c04a0d", "isManagedByNps": "0", "amenities": [], "managedByOrg": "Aramark Destinations", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim, Grand Canyon National Park", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Rustic Lodge and Cabins", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "E32D2136-A184-4C1A-91D2-4C20CEF9CBAF", "value": "National Historic Landmark", "name": "Designation"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

The view is worth the walk!</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>Grandeur Point offers an especially dramatic view of Bright Angel Canyon, which slices directly across Grand Canyon and cuts deep into both the South and North Rims. Grand Canyon Village sits near the southern head of this massive side canyon, which has formed along a geologic structure known as the Bright Angel Fault. Many faults, large and small, cut the rock layers of Grand Canyon, but the Bright Angel Fault is probably the most famous. Movement of rocks along this fault has created a major conduit for water flowing down to the Colorado River, including Garden Creek from the South Rim (fed by springs at Indian Garden, far below) and Bright Angel Creek from the North Rim (fed by Angel Spring and Roaring Springs, the source of all drinking water within the park). Since movement along faults causes breaks in the shear cliffs of Grand Canyon, they often serve as access points for trails descending from the canyon rims. Where the switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail descend through the break in the shear cliff of tan Coconino Sandstone several hundred feet below the rim, one can clearly observe the offset along the Bright Angel Fault. The displacement along this portion of the fault is about 200 feet (60 m), with the western side of the fault uplifted relative to the eastern side. However, this normal displacement along the Bright Angel Fault represents only the most recent chapter of its long history; like other major faults in Grand Canyon, the Bright Angel Fault traces its origin back to the formation of the proto-North American continent about 1.7 billion years ago. Since its initial formation, the Bright Angel Fault has been reactivated several times, sometimes as a normal fault (such as it is now) and sometimes as a reverse and/or strike-slip fault.<br />  </p>", "audioDescription": "A flat wooden bench sits in a paved pull-out just off a paved trail following edge of Grand Canyon.

There, in 1890, Pete Berry and fellow miners discovered copper and began digging the Last Chance Mine. The ore was rich (15 to 30 percent pure copper), but like all Grand Canyon mines, the amount of ore was small. Berry created other opportunities to make money. In 1897, he built the Grandview Hotel near here, and adventuresome tourists mingled with the miners on Horseshoe Mesa. But, when the railroad came to the Grand Canyon in 1901, its depot was 14 miles away from Berry's hotel. In 1907, copper prices crashed.

The well-built trail eventually provided access to more tourists than miners, as Grandview Point provided one of the best access routes into the canyon at that time. Relatively undamaged segments of the original miner trail remain in the upper portion of Grandview Trail, testifying to the engineering prowess of the builders as they devised creative solutions to the problems that the landscape presented.<br /> <br /> The trail descends to the right of the established Grandview Point overlook. The Kaibab/Toroweap section traverses steep slopes, and the old trail is eroded in places, so careful attention is critical. Vertical steps were placed by constructing log \"cribs\" that were chained or pinned to the cliff face to provide a foundation for the trail where nature provided none. The exposure along these sections impresses some hikers to the point of being considered hazardous. Unfortunately, several of the historic cribs were swept away by landslides during the winter of 2005. Trail crews restored the trail, but not the historical context of the old logs. A series of sloping ledges at the top of the Coconino Sandstone cliff demands caution, especially when icy or wet. Be careful throughout the Kaibab and Toroweap sections - a fall here could have catastrophic consequences.<br /> <br /> The original cobblestone \"riprap\" trail construction remains throughout most of the Coconino section. Large slabs of sandstone placed edgewise provided a durable and labor intensive walking surface. The trail comes to the top of a dramatic east-facing gully at the contact between the Coconino Sandstone and Hermit Shale (known locally as Coconino Saddle), which offers tantalizing views into the upper valley of Hance Creek. Steep cobblestone switchbacks below Coconino Saddle descend through the Hermit Shale to the Supai Formation, where the steepness of the trail lessens as it begins a more gradual traverse out into the canyon and down to Horseshoe Mesa.<br /> <br /> Along the trail, you might notice what appears to be trash or remnants of past mining operations, including rusty cans, nails, tools and structures. These objects are actually protected as archaeological resources. <strong>Please leave these objects as you found them, where you found them</strong>.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only. </strong>There are no maintained water sources along Grandview Trail. Seasonal springs below Horseshoe Mesa may offer water (which must be treated or filtered), but are not reliable.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coconino Saddle</strong><br /> <em>Recommended summer day hike</em>; <em>no signs present</em><br /> 2.2 miles (3.5 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,000 feet (305 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Horseshoe Mesa</strong><br /> <em>Please be respectful of campers</em><br /> 6.0 miles (9.6 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,500 feet (760 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Viewpoint</strong><br /> <em>This point is on the very northern edge of the western arm of Horseshoe Mesa.</em><br /> 7.6 miles (12.2 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,500 feet (760 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Page Spring</strong><br /> <em><strong>Water contains high arsenic levels</strong></em><br /> 7.4 miles (11.9 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 3,040 feet (925 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>ANY</strong> camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> Backpackers camping on Horseshoe Mesa (BF5) must camp in designated sites. Three (3) small group sites are located east of the standing masonry structure. The large group site is further north and east of the little butte that caps Horseshoe Mesa. Vault toilet facilities are located at both areas. <strong>Camping is not allowed in or near historic mines and structures</strong>. Camping in the Cottonwood (BG9) and Hance Creek (BE9) use areas is \"at-large\". All hikers should bring animal-proof food containers; mice and ravens are skilled at opening and looting packs or bags in this area.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p>Every year, this trail bears witness to accidents resulting in serious injury or death. <strong>Grandview Trail is steep, rarely maintained, and does not provide access to the Colorado River.</strong> It is not a recommended first hike into the canyon.<br /> <br /> Old decomposing mines are inherently unsafe. For your safety and the protection of local bat populations, all historic mines are closed to visitation. You may see artifacts scattered about-these are protected by federal antiquities laws.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Cave of the Domes is closed to protect roosting bats and other sensitive cave resources.</strong> Bats are particularly sensitive to human disturbance and will abandon roost sites. Permits are required to enter caves in Grand Canyon National Park due to the extremely sensitive nature of the cultural and natural resources inside. Contact the Backcountry Information Center for information.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia, </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Cape Royal and Grandview Point Quads (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p> <p> </p>", "audioDescription": "At the top of a vertical wayside panel at the Grandview Trail Trailhead, text reads: \"Welcome to Grandview Trail.<br />First used by American Indians to gather mineral paints on Horseshoe Mesa and later used by copper miners, the Grandview Trail does not access the river and is rarely maintained.

Boucher, the \"hermit\" of Hermit Creek basin, lived in this area for 20 years. Boucher built the Boucher Trail (west of the Hermit Trail) and seasonal residences at Dripping Springs and near Boucher Creek. Though socially active in the South Rim community, residents labeled Boucher a hermit because he lived alone.<br /> <br /> The modern trailhead is located just west of Hermits Rest. Follow the dirt road from the restrooms to make your way to the trailhead. <strong>There is no parking for day hikers at this trailhead when the Hermit (Red) Route shuttle is active; day hikers must ride the free shuttle bus to reach the trailhead.</strong><br /> <br /> <b>For experienced desert hikers only.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Water from springs must be purified.</b><br /> <br /> Allow extra hiking time; <b>conditions are more difficult than on the Bright Angel and South Kaibab Trails</b>.</p> <h3>Trail Desciption</h3>   <p>The upper section of the Hermit Trail is quite steep, dropping almost 2,000 vertical feet (610 m) in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). Passage through the Kaibab Formation and Coconino Sandstone is via well-defined switchbacks. Most of the Hermit Trail was originally surfaced with large hand-fitted rock slabs that created a smooth walking surface. Ongoing erosion has claimed much of this remarkably labor-intensive paving, but a few isolated fragments survive, especially in the Coconino Sandstone. Fossilized animal tracks have been noted in many locations throughout the canyon, but they were first studied in detail along the Hermit Trail. Observant hikers can see a few of these fossilized lizard-like tracks in the lower half of the Coconino Sandstone.<br /> <br /> The trail enters Waldron Basin, a quiet, isolated pocket within the Hermit side canyon, at 1.2 miles (1.9 km). The Waldron Trail junction is encountered soon after at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), followed by the Dripping Springs Trail junction at 1.75 miles (2.8 km). To continue on the Hermit Trail, stay right at both junctions. Dripping Springs, however, does make an excellent day hike destination. After the Dripping Springs trail junction, the Hermit Trail drops down along the east side of Hermit Creek gorge. Santa Maria Spring is reached at 2.5 miles (4 km) along the trail, offering a trickle of water and a historic masonry rest house which provides welcome shade during the summer.<br /> <br /> Continuing on the Hermit Trail past this point is generally not recommended for a day hike during the summer. During cooler months, Lookout Point, an additional 1.5 miles (2.4 km) down the trail from Santa Maria Spring, is also a reasonable single-day option for those seeking a longer hike. Between Santa Maria Spring and the top of the Redwall Limestone at Cathedral Stairs, the Hermit Trail is characterized by long traverses through the Supai Formation. This section of the trail is tucked up against the west facing walls of the south rim and offers hikers a period of extended shade during the hotter months.<br /> <br /> At Cathedral Stairs, the descent becomes unrelenting. An endless series of rocky switchbacks eventually leads hikers through the Redwall cliff and down the west-facing talus below Cope Butte to the intersection with the Tonto Trail. The Tonto Trail is an important Inner Canyon route that allows access in both directions along the Tonto Platform, east to Monument Creek, west to Hermit Creek. Turn left (west) and follow the Tonto Trail about a mile to the Hermit Creek campsite. Be sure to walk downstream a short distance during your stay at Hermit Creek, or even descend all the way to the Colorado River at Hermit Rapid.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Waldron Basin</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,240 feet (378 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring Trail Junction</strong><br /> 3.6 miles (5.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3-4 hours / 1370 feet (418 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Maria Spring</strong><br /> 5 miles (8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 1,680 feet (512 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring</strong> (via the Dripping Spring Trail)<br /> 7 miles (11.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 5-7 hours / 1040 feet (317 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Breezy Point</strong><br /> 11 miles (17.7 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,220 feet (677 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Tonto Trail Junction</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Tonto Trail Junction and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 14 miles (22.5 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,430 feet (1,045 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hermit Creek</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Hermit Creek and back in a day. </em><em>Water requires purification.</em></strong><br /> 16.4 miles (26.4 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,740 feet (1,140 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Colorado River / Hermit Rapids</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to the Colorado River and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 19.4 miles (31.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4.340 feet (1,323 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>A spring-fed water station is available near the vault toilets along the gravel road that leads to the Hermit Trail parking area. Santa Maria Spring, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) down the trail, offers year-round spring water. Dripping Springs, 7 miles (11.3 km) down the trail (via the Dripping Springs side trail), also offers year-round spring water. Hermit Creek is a perennial water source for those descending down the trail for a stay at the backcountry campsites there. Water from any natural sources in Grand Canyon, including springs, creeks, and the Colorado River, must be purified before drinking.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>From March 1st to November 30th, access to the Hermit Road is restricted to shuttle buses only. However, backpackers with a valid backcountry permit for the Hermit or Boucher Trails are allowed access by personal vehicle during this time. To gain access to the Hermit Road, please enter the numerical code provided by the Backcountry Information Center. Drive eight miles (12.9 km) west along Hermit Road to Hermits Rest then continue on the dirt road 0.25 miles (0.4 km) to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> From December 1st through the end of February, the Hermit Road is open to all traffic. The park shuttle buses do not operate along the Hermit Road during this time.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>any</strong> camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> The only legal places to camp in the Hermit Creek drainage are the designated campsites at Hermit Creek (BM7, toilet on site) and Hermit Rapids (BM8, no toilet). A sign with a prominent \"L\" marks the large group site near the toilet at BM7. Large groups of 7-11 people must use this site. At-large camping is not permitted along the Hermit Trail.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Grand Canyon Quad (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day. From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately. In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting - sip fluids only when thirsty. Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>- a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Much of the pioneer history in northern Arizona revolves around various schemes of development to promote and capitalize on the beauty and intrigue of Grand Canyon. The Hermit Creek basin was the scene of one of the most aggressive of these improvement efforts. Initiated by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911, this program involved development of the rim and also included the construction of what was, at the time, a state-of-the-art rim-to-river trail.<br /> <br /> The Hermit Trail was built to serve a luxury campsite near Hermit Creek. Hermit Camp predated Phantom Ranch by 10 years and in its heyday was complete with a tramway from the rim, a functional automobile for transportation within the facility, and a Fred Harvey Company chef. Operations ceased in 1930, but for two decades Hermit Camp was the last word in gracious tourism below the rim. As is always the case at Grand Canyon, time and erosion have taken a heavy toll. The old Hermit Trail is today a mere shadow of its former self, but for experienced and knowledgeable canyon backpackers, the walk offers a direct link to the excitement and romance of the early days at Grand Canyon.</p>", "audioDescription": "A rock and pebble-strewn path leads a quarter-mile (400 m) from Hermits Rest west along the rim of Grand Canyon to the Hermit Trail Trailhead. There are a few picnic tables in an open area along the way. Near the trailhead is a small parking lot for vehicles with government-issued handicap placards and backpackers with valid permits for overnight camping. A vertical wayside panel at the trailhead reads: \"Welcome to Hermit Trail. The Hermit trail was originally built by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911 and provided access to the developed Hermit Camp and Waldron Basin tourist areas.

The distinctive style of this structure is unique and skillfully crafted out of native materials that blend in with the natural environment.<br /> <br /> Today, this location is frequented by hikers, travelers, and history enthusiasts that arrive by foot, bicycle, the Hermit Road (Red) Route shuttle bus, and, during the months of December through February, personal vehicles.</p>", "audioDescription": "Move through a set of central wood and glass double doors onto the flagstone floor of a roughly 25-foot (8 m) wide by 20-foot (6 m) long Great Room inside Hermits Rest. The roof above soars nearly two stories high, topped with a flat, wooden beam ceiling. Two massive 18-inch (46 cm) round vertical wooden support pillars stand at the left and right about eight feet (2.4 m) in front of the doors, ringed with black metal candelabra. Large windows in the front of the room let in streams of natural light. Note several free-standing tables and display cabinets filled with books and gifts placed along the front windows and about the room. There is a four-foot (1.2 m) tall glass-enclosed display counter about six feet (2 m) to the right of the right-hand pillar filled with jewelry and other items for sale. Twenty feet (6 m) in front of the doors, the entire south wall opens into an enormous alcove, 15 feet (4.5 m) tall by 15 feet (4.5 m) wide by 10 feet (3 m) deep. The flagstone floor continues into the alcove up a small step from the rest of the room. A six-foot (2 m) tall arched stone fireplace sits at the back of the alcove, decorated with several antique kitchen and fireplace tools which you may touch. Note there is a low, six-foot (2 m) wide wooden bench directly in front of the fireplace, flanked by two wooden chairs with lattice-strap seat pans and carved wooden backs. A large stack of wood sits to the left of the fireplace behind a small wooden side table. Two additional black metal candelabra are affixed five-feet (1.5 m) high on the alcove walls to the left and right of the fireplace. To the east of the Great Room, two smaller seven-foot (2.1 m) tall stone arches lead into a curio shop with a smaller stone fireplace. Other souvenirs, artwork, and clothing items are available here. Outside, a limestone porch overlooks the canyon to the north underneath a wooden roof. Move up a couple stairs at the western end of the building to a small patio area with a snack bar. Fifteen feet (4.5 m) further west, two more stone steps lead up to a 10-foot (3 m) wide rocky trail leading to the Hermit Trailhead. Standing just a few feet (about 2 m) from the rim of Grand Canyon, Hermits Rest is a stone building tucked into a small man-made earthen mound, built around and atop the building to blend it in with its setting. Using the natural timber and boulders of the area, the exposed portions of the structure look like a natural rock formation. Two stone chimneys appear as outgrowths of the building. The main chimney appears as a stone outcropping rising from the ground on the south side of the building. It is generally cylindrical in shape and the stones are stained by soot. About three feet (1 m) above the ground, a course of stones projects out from the chimney. Above them, rectangular stones are oriented vertically and the gaps between them provide openings for the exhaust. The holes facing the south side have been blocked by additional stones. The stones in this course are rounder in shape. Thin, rectangular stones are situated above the openings and span the diameter of the chimney. A secondary chimney extends up from the east elevation wall. It is fully integrated with the stone wall below and gently narrows as it rises. It is generally cylindrical in shape and the individual stones decrease in size as it rises. Rectangular stones, oriented vertically, cap the top. Hermits Rest blends easily with its environment. Each stone is irregular in shape and varies greatly in size from each other. Generally, the lower stones are larger and rectangular. The stones above are more irregular in shape and smaller in size. A large stone lintel is present above the east elevation window opening. A small porch supported by peeled log posts stands to one side of the outside observation area, overlooking the canyon rim.", "isPassportStampLocation": "1", "passportStampLocationDescription": "Hermits Rest has a unique, dated passport cancellation stamp which reads \"Hermit's Rest\" and \"Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - Est. 1919\".

Opening to great fanfare on January 14, 1905, the hotel catered to a wealthy clientele. Imagine guests' delight upon finding a music room, a solarium, a billiard hall, an underground grotto (where men enjoyed a friendly game of cards), a barbershop, two roof gardens, an art room, and gift shop. For $4.50 and upwards per night, guests were treated to finely decorated rooms with both hot and cold running water.\" Text to the right of the photograph reads: \"Keeping with the Santa Fe Railway's affinity for naming their hotels after Spanish explorers, \"El Tovar\" honored Don Pedro de Tovar, who visited the Hopi mesas to the east in 1540.\" A quote from the Coconino Sun from May 24, 1902 at the top right reads: \"The Santa Fe is going to build the most expensive hotel...at the Grand Canyon...the idea of the architect is to bring the building into harmony with the wonderful scenery of the canyon rather than to put a blot upon its beauty by the erection of a conventional structure.\" A second black-and-white photograph inset at the bottom right shows the interior of one of the rooms with two wooden sleigh beds, a couple rocking chairs, a large dresser topped with a mirror, and a smaller vanity.

By October 1902, he had persuaded his brother Emery to join him. A year later, the brothers established their photography business near Bright Angel Trailhead after receiving permission from Ralph Cameron, who at the time owned Bright Angel Trail. They camped out in a small tent on the canyon rim before building a small wooden house in 1906, which they called Kolb Studio.<br /> <br /> Over the next 12 years, the Kolb brothers established themselves as both photographers and adventurers. From capturing unorthodox photos of hard-to-reach areas of the canyon to documenting their 101 days running the Colorado River on film with a motion-picture camera, Ellsworth and Emery revealed images that few had dreamed of. Selling their images in leather-bound books for three dollars each and touring the country to present their film lecture series, the Kolb brothers made a name for themselves and opened the eyes of a nation to this wonder of the world.<br /> <br /> For decades, the Kolb brothers continued to make a living out of Kolb Studio on Grand Canyon's South Rim. Later in life, when their contractual agreements with the park ended, the National Park Service actually wanted to demolish this studio in the 1960s. The architecture wasn't quite in line with the style and theme of other buildings in the park. After several years of quibbling between Emery and the agency, the structure was saved when Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966, legislation that effectively protected park structures over 50 years old from being destroyed.</p> <h3>Tour the Private Residence</h3> <p><strong>Enter the little seen depths of this five-story building for a behind the scenes tour of the Kolb family's private home and photography studio. </strong></p> <ul> <li>Your guide will weave stories of the Kolb family members.<br />  </li> <li><strong>Days Offered:</strong> Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday</li> <li><strong>Time</strong>: 1 pm | 60 minutes (one hour) </li> <li> <p><strong>Participant Size:</strong> 8</p> </li> <li><strong>Meet Location</strong>: Gallery downstairs (access is through the store).<br />  </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/experience-grand-canyon/guided-tours/kolb-studio-tour\">Additional information about the tour</a>  </li> <li><strong>Price:</strong> $30/person | <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/reservations?%2Freserve%2Ftt3-kolb-studio\">Register online</a></li> </ul>", "audioDescription": "This historic studio is open year-round.

From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> In this part of the canyon, instead of being confined by the hard Vishnu basement rocks within the narrow Inner Gorge to the west, the Colorado River instead winds its way through layers of soft, purple sandstone belonging to the Dox Formation. This is why Lipan Point features such spectacular views of the river. Above these purple layers is the black Cardenas Basalt, formed by lava flows erupting due to continental collisions during the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia over one billion years ago. To the west, one can see another stretch of river cutting down through layers of purple, orange, and brown rocks; these are the Bass Formation, Hakatai Shale, and Shinumo Sandstone, respectively. One can also see where the river crosses from these layers into the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks underneath to begin forming the Inner Gorge.</p>", "audioDescription": "Lipan Point is located just west of Navajo Point and the Watchtower at Desert View Point.

Generally rectangular in plan, the small building is constructed of coursed rubble masonry.<br /> <br /> Commissioned to directly compete with the Kolb brothers and Kolb Studio, Mary Colter designed Lookout Studio in a similar manner as Hopi House: to imitate the stone dwellings of the Pueblo Indians of the southwest. Inspired by the natural forms of the landscape around the site, she used these influences to guide her design.<br /> <br /> The parapet rooflines and stone chimneys mimic the irregular shapes of surrounding bedrock. The interior of the building is divided into several levels, with structural log work exposed in posts, beams, and ceiling joists. The floor is scored concrete and the interior walls are exposed stone. Because of all of the viewing windows around the walls of the structure (which naturally feature Colter's trademark baby blue window frames), the interior is considerably lighter than most of Colter's other buildings.</p>", "audioDescription": "This two-story stone building, approximately 40- by 50-feet (12- by 15-meters) square, is perched on the edge of Grand Canyon. Through its use of local stone and wood, the building emulates the natural scenery along the rim and appears to rise from the rock around it. The walls in front rise to an irregular stone parapet, incorporating the building's chimneys. Inside, a main level houses a gift shop selling photographic prints, rock specimens, and books under a low pitch shed roof with log rafters. With its banks of large windows, Lookout Studio affords outstanding views from all floors and receives a great deal of light. The Bright Angel Trail can be seen from here. Condors often soar up and down the cliffs in the summer, using the warmed afternoon winds to cruise along the canyon. A wooden staircase at the back left of the shop leads up nine steps to a three-foot (1 m) wide landing through a wood and glass door onto an open wooden balcony. A second set of stairs at the right leads down seven steps across a six-foot (2 m) square landing through a wood and glass door onto an open outdoor stone terrace. High-powered telescopes are available at both viewing areas. Two additional outdoor observation areas sit below this first terrace. Facing back toward the door, these are accessed via a narrow stone staircase at the back left of the terrace. With the metal railing on your left, move down nine steps to a small landing and turn left.

The Fred Harvey Company and the Santa Fe Railroad constructed the original \"Motor Lodge\" here in 1927. Traveling by automobile to the parks was quickly becoming fashionable. Rather than having to travel by train or carriage, people could journey in their own automobiles.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s, 36 cabins were added and 22 cabins were moved from Bright Angel Lodge. Many of the 120 cabins were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by more contemporary two-story hotel rooms in 1968. The only architectural component remaining from historic lodge buildings are the original stone pillars.</p>", "audioDescription": "Maswik Lodge is a contemporary, motel-style lodge located about a quarter-mile (400 m) from Grand Canyon with a shuttle bus stop out front.

Moving through the front door from the wide concrete patio, a 20-foot (6 m) long blond wood registration desk fills the left side of the foyer.

A wealthy businessman from Chicago, Mather was avid conservationist and supporter of public lands, who moved to Washington D.C. in 1915 to help found the National Park Service. Appointed its first director in 1917 he continued to promote park access, development, and use until he left office in 1929. <br /> <br /> Mather believed that magnificent scenery should be the first criterion in establishing a national park, and made efforts to have new parks established before the lands were developed for other purposes. Mather always wished to have the parks supported by avid users, who would then communicate their support to their elected representatives. During his tenure the Park Service grew to include sites such as Grand Canyon, Shenandoah, Great Smoky Mountains, Mammoth Cave National Parks, and many others.<br /> <br /> He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good that he has done.</p>", "audioDescription": "Located about 1800 feet (550 m) northeast from the visitor center along a wide, smooth concrete path is Mather Point. The viewing area here is quite extensive with two major overlooks, each lined with four-foot (1.2 m) high metal safety railings built into the rocks that project out into the canyon. A plaque honoring Stephen Mather sits at the top right of a 20-foot (6 m) wide set of concrete stairs that lead down to the main overlook area. Note there is also a ramp down to the overlook located about 140 feet (42 m) west of the stairs. Following along the right handrail, move down 6 steps to a concrete landing.

Working at the canyon until 1940 Eddie McKee helped to lay the frame work for modern Interpretation of Grand Canyon resources and greatly expanded the collective knowledge of both the ancient environments and conditions that formed Grand Canyon's rock layers as well as the forces and processes necessary to carve the vast canyon we see today.  </p>", "audioDescription": "Located just a few minutes' walk from the Rim Trail, near the Shrine of the Ages, McKee Amphitheater features three sections of about 25 wooden benches each on a gently-sloping asphalt-paved surface with aisles between each section.

At the front right of the amphitheater is a six-foot (2 m) diameter firepit just off of the stage, surrounded by a low, 15-inch (38 cm) tall limestone ring.

Highway 67 to the North Rim will also remain closed for the foreseeable future due to impacts from the Dragon Bravo Fire.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Just over <strong>1,100 feet (335 m) below Grand Canyon's rim</strong>, this first rest area offers visitors a taste of the struggles and rewards Grand Canyon's steep trails present.<strong> For most visitors, the 3-mile (4.8 km) round-trip hike from the South Rim requires a 2-4 hour commitment depending on health, hiking ability, and rest stops.</strong></p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance:</strong> 3 miles (4.8 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong> 1,120 feet (340 m)<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time:</strong> 2-4 hours</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your itinerary with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>", "audioDescription": "At the base of a towering cliff, and just above and alongside the trail, several steps lead up to a rustic stone resthouse. The building is about 20 feet long and 10 feet wide and all four sides are open to the air. The roof is supported by stone masonry pillars in each corner. Inside, and shaded from the sun, are several stone benches. Just below the building, and slightly down trail, a water bottle filling station is in operation during spring, summer and fall. Continuing down trail a path ascends stone steps up a hill to a composting toilet. From 1 1/2 Mile Resthouse the view of Grand Canyon is dominated by steep slopes and shear cliffs. The canyon walls of alternating red, white, and yellow rise a thousand feet about you, while the stair stepped cliffs and slopes of red rock drop away below you to a distant green plateau of rock and plants some 2,000 feet below you. In the center of the plateau a small pocket of dark green trees marks Indian Garden, a campground and day use area within the canyon. A distance white trail cuts across the plateau from the trees to point above a steep walled canyon of black rock at the very bottom of Grand Canyon.

His work helped to create many national parks. Explore this point for a good spot to watch the shadows and changing light throughout the day, just as the artist did.</p> <h3>Thomas Moran</h3> <p>In 1873, Hudson River School artist Thomas Moran joined John Wesley Powell on his exploratory expeditions of Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau. Shortly after his return, Moran set to work on a canvas equal in size and ambition to his earlier 1872 painting from Yellowstone National Park, \"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\". In 1874, Congress purchased the result, \"The Chasm of the Colorado\" (1873-1874, National Museum of American Art) for $10,000. It became the second of Moran's western landscapes to hang in the United States Capitol, and is now part of the Smithsonian Institution, residing primarily at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p> <h3>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h3> <p>Geology is a prominent feature at any Grand Canyon viewpoint, but especially so at Moran Point. From here, all three main rock groups of Grand Canyon are clearly visible.<br /> <br /> The horizontal sedimentary layers of rock that make up the majority of what we see in Grand Canyon's depths are known as the Layered Paleozoic Rocks. Beneath these relatively flat-lying layers are the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, which represent a significant portion of the canyon's geologic record even though they are only exposed in a few isolated sections of the canyon. These tilted layers are only visible from a few select viewpoints along the rim, including here at Moran Point. The black Vishnu Schist and pink Zoroaster Granite, as well as a few other associated metamorphic and igneous rocks are collectively known as the Vishnu basement rocks. These are the oldest rocks in the canyon, and thus are found far below near the Colorado River, beneath the over-lying sedimentary layers.<br /> <br /> The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> From Moran Point, one can observe prominent tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup directly to the north, sitting on the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks to the west. The short segment of the Colorado River visible here is cutting through a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, with tall cliffs of brown Shinumo Sandstone above. These vibrant orange layers of rock can also be seen on this side of the river, directly below the viewpoint to the northwest. Beyond these layers, on the far side of the canyon, one can observe four distinct layers of rock sitting on the Vishnu basement rocks. In order, these are a sill of black Cardenas Basalt, purple layers of Bass Formation, a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, and brown cliffs of Shinumo Sandstone.</p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "aca63145-bcda-49e4-b7e2-684b92274a2d", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Parking - Auto", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Desertview Drive", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [{"title": "Moran Point", "id": "D7458531-5740-4E21-A712-DFB5F772238C", "type": "multimedia/galleries", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=6644901&id=D7458531-5740-4E21-A712-DFB5F772238C"}], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Beginning 1,000 feet (305 m) higher than South Rim trails, hikers can glimpse the vast expanse of Bright Angel Canyon through fir trees, aspen, ferns and wildflowers.<br /> <br /> Built throughout the 1920s to match the quality and grade of the South Kaibab Trail, the present-day North Kaibab Trail replaced an older route infamous for crossing Bright Angel Creek 94 times (the present-day trail crosses only 6 times). Though masterfully constructed and maintained, North Kaibab Trail is challenging for day hikers as well as rim-to-rim hikers.</span></p> <h3>Day Hike Turnaround Points</h3> <p><strong>North Kaibab Trailhead</strong> (8,241 feet / 2,510 m)<br /> Be sure to pick up a map before hiking.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coconino Overlook</strong> (7,450 feet / 2,270 m)<br /> 1.4 miles (2.3 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 1-2 hours / 790 vertical feet (241 m)<br /> <br /> <strong>Supai Tunnel </strong>(6,840 feet / 2,085 m)<br /> 4.0 miles (6.4 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1400 vertical feet (425 m)<br /> Note: the composting toilet at Supai Tunnel is closed for renovation between April 6, and May 6, 2025.<br /> <br /> <strong>Redwall Bridge</strong> (6,040 feet / 1,840 m)<br /> 5.2 miles (8.4 km)<strong> roundtrip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 2200 vertical feet (670 m)<br /> <br /> Check with a park ranger before attempting to hike past Redwall Bridge and back in one day.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>During the season, water stations are available at North Kaibab trailhead and North Rim Backcountry Information Center. Potable water may also be available at Manzanita Rest House and Cottonwood Campground. Water is NOT available at Roaring Springs and during 2025, Supai Tunnel,. Never fully rely on these water stations, as pipeline breaks and freezing weather impact them. Always carry a way to treat water from the creek in case water stations are not functioning.<br /> <br /> Prior to beginning your hike, check our <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a></strong> webpage. If you are on the North Rim, stop by the Visitor Center/Rager Roost, or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/north-rim-backcountry-information-center.htm\">Backcountry Information Center</a> (in the North Rim Admin Building) for water status updates.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>After an initial steep descent down the head of a side canyon via a series of numerous switchbacks through lush greenery and impressive views below the trailhead, the trail approaches the distinctive Supai Tunnel. Here hikers will find potable water (mid-May to mid-October) and pit toilets. No emergency phone is available.<br /> <br /> Switchbacks continue to the massive cliffs of Redwall Limestone, where for long stretches the trail has been blasted out of the cliff. The Redwall section is awe-inspiring in every way; fantastic exposure and views contrast with the engineering marvel of providing access to this location.<br /> <br /> From Redwall Bridge, the bulk of the trail's descent meets the flatter bottom of Bright Angel Canyon and Roaring Springs. Here, water gushes forth directly out of the cliffs, cascading over moss and fern to form Bright Angel Creek (which will be a constant companion all the way to the Colorado River). This giant spring provides drinking water for every visitor and resident within Grand Canyon National Park. The water is delivered to the South Rim via a pipeline buried beneath the North Kaibab Trail (installed 1965 - 1970). You can see this amazing pipeline as it stretches across the Colorado River on the underside of the Silver Bridge from Bright Angel Trail.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Please consider seasonal variations in trail conditions. </strong><br /> <br /> During winter months, the upper section of North Kaibab trail can be ice-covered and snowbound. North Rim hikers must be prepared for extreme winter conditions with extra food, clothing layers, and tractions devices.<br /> <br /> During hotter months (May - September), it is critical that hikers begin their hike well before dawn or after 3 p.m. Success and enjoyment depends on the amount of time spent planning ahead and preparing for all conditions. Success in the summer can be as simple as staying off the trail and out of the sun between 10 am-4 pm. Hiking the entire North Kaibab Trail in a single day is not recommended, particularly in summer, as it would be extremely difficult to avoid hiking in the heat of the day.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your itinerary with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes **hyponatremia **-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest.

The parking lot for the North Kaibab Trailhead is located along the east side of Route 67, a little over two miles (three and a half kilometers) north of Grand Canyon Lodge. Two wildlife-proof metal garbage cans and bicycle rack stand at the foot of a one-way road that loops right uphill around a long, slender lot with diagonal parking spaces. Note at the top of the lot, there is a wheelchair accessible vault toilet, and another wildlife-proof metal garbage can. Also note there is a mule pen above the lot. A long, wood-post lined bridle path leads downhill from the pen, alongside and parallel to the long south side of the lot, and continues past the North Kaibab trailhead at the foot of the lot. At the base of the lot, close to Route 67, move south up a curb onto a six foot (two meter) wide stone landing lined with boulders on either side at the top of a stone staircase. Continue down five roughhewn, uneven stone steps onto the dirt and gravel ground. Note a water filling station to the left at the base of the stone staircase. Sitting atop a low, rectangular stone base, an image of a rock wall in Grand Canyon fills the face of a four foot (one and half meter) square metal panel, with three water spigots protruding from its face. From the base of the stone staircase, continue about 15 feet (five meters) forward to an eight-foot (two-and-a-half meter) tall, double-sided, wooden wayside with a small shingle roof sitting atop a three-foot tall by four-foot wide (90 by 120 centimeter) stone base. The wayside sits in a large, dirt and gravel open area, lined with a two-foot tall boulder wall. Note a number of trails all converge at this location. The Bridle Path continues alongside the roadway to the west, the Arizona Trail on the other side of the road leads north, and the North Kaibab Trail leads south to the Coconino Overlook, Supai Tunnel, Redwall Bridge, and the Manzanita Springs Day Use Area. The front face of the wayside, entitled “North Kaibab Trail,” tells the story how the North Kaibab Trail came to be. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. The back face of the wayside, entitled “A Matter of Feet,” discusses how the interrelated factors of elevation, temperature, precipitation, soil depth, and sunlight determine where plants grow in the canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. About 15 feet (five meters) beyond the wayside is a metal, six-foot tall, double-panel information panel. The left-hand panel details the trail’s elevation profile. Beside an aerial photograph of the trail at right, information at the left lists the distances, elevations, and water sources of points along the trail. At the bottom left, it provides detailed hiking information specific to Grand Canyon. On the right-hand panel, a map at the left shows the trail’s path down to Phantom Ranch, above a second view of the large elevation changes as you move along the trail. At the right, Hike Smart tips instruct how to take care of yourself on the trail, above a primer on Trail Courtesy at the lower right. Sub-Script North Kaibab Trail Wayside Panel A title at the top left of the panel reads, “North Kaibab Trail.” An illustration beneath the text shows an Indigenous American standing on a rocky outcropping, pointing across the vast Grand Canyon. A sepia tone photograph of a section of the Bright Angel Fault fills the bottom of the panel. Text at the middle left reads: Whether you hike just a mile or go rim-to-rim, you are among a long lineage of North Rim hikers, beginning with American Indians thousands of years ago. In 1902, when cartographer Francois Matthes began mapping the canyon there was no rim-to-rim trail here, even though tourists had been coming to the South Rim since the 1890s. Matthes had to swim his horses across the Colorado River to reach the north side, and then it took him and his crew six days to reach the North Rim on the Kaibab Plateau, where you stand. In 1906, David Rust and crew, hired by the Grand Canyon Transportation Company, built the original rim-to-rim connector trail—then considered an extension of Bright Angel Trail. His trail began at the head of Bright Angel Canyon, crossed the river by cable car, and connected with the Bright Angel Trail on the south side. By 1928, the National Park Service completed the present trail route from here to Roaring Springs and renamed it the North Kaibab Trail. A series of six inset photographs fill the right two-thirds of the panel. Beginning at the top left, the first black-and-white photograph shows a man standing atop a rocky outcropping beside a massive, triangular wooden brace. A metal cage hangs from cables that extend across the canyon towards a high mountain wall in the background. A caption reads: David Rust, in 1910, stands with his cable car, which made crossing the Colorado River possible for visitors. Moving to the right, a second black-and-white photograph shows an elevated view of three, wooden buildings alongside a riverbank at the base of the canyon. A caption reads: The Santa Fe Railway built Phantom Ranch in 1922 for the Fred Harvey Company, replacing Roosevelt Camp. In the center of the wayside, a third black-and-white photograph shows two men standing atop a rocky rise surrounded by desert scrub, next to a small table with a scope, and a shade umbrella. The man at the left writes in a notebook. A caption reads: Francois Matthes (left) and crew member mapping Grand Canyon on the North Rim, 1904. Matthes made the first topographic map of the canyon. A 1927 quote by Francois Emile Matthes at the top right of the panel reads: In the spring of 1902. . . we began to seek a route across to the north side. But at that time there was no trail across from rim to rim, nor was there a bridge over the Colorado. At the middle right of the panel, beneath this quote, the first of two black-and-white photographs shows an aerial view of two workers hanging on a series of cables stretching across a wide section of the river below. A caption above the photograph reads: The National Park Service began improvements to Rust’s trail in 1920, replacing his cable car with a suspension bridge in 1921, and again, in 1928. A second black-and-white photograph to the right shows two men grooming a trail with rakes and shovels beside a tall, rock wall. A caption above this photograph reads: In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps made many improvements to the trail you enjoy today. Under these two pictures, a final color photograph shows a trail section along the edge of the canyon, underneath a rocky overhang. A caption reads: National Park Service trail crews blasted rock cliffs to carve out sections of the North Kaibab Trail in the 1920s. In the background, across a wide chasm, the colored bands of the various rock layers of the canyon are clearly visible, floor to rim. A Matter of Feet Wayside Panel Color images of the plants that inhabit Grand Canyon at different elevations along the North Kaibab Trail cover the face of this wayside. Entitled, “A Matter of Feet,” text at the middle left reads: As you hike the North Kaibab Trail toward the Colorado River, you pass through many different plant communities. From this trailhead to Phantom Ranch the elevation drops almost 6,000 feet (1,800 m). Notice as you hike downward how temperatures get warmer and the plant communities change—sometimes abruptly. Elevation, temperature, precipitation, soil depth, and sunlight are all interrelated factors that determine where plants grow in the canyon. Here, at 8,250 feet (2,515 m) you are surrounded by a ponderosa pine forest, but drop down the trail to 3,000 feet (900 m) and you are standing in desert scrub. For every 1,000 feet (300 m) you drop in elevation, temperatures rise about 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2–3 °C). This translates to a 20–25 degree Fahrenheit (11–14 °C) difference between North Rim and the bottom of the canyon. At the top left, words over an image of an evergreen forest read: Boreal Forest Above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) A mix of conifers like Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and white and blue spruce with patches of grassy meadows. To the right of center at the top, a rectangular inset photograph shows a stand of tall pine trees. A caption reads: Ponderosa Pine 7,200–8,300 feet (2,200 –2,530 m). Tall, red-barked trees that often grow in pure ponderosa stands. To the left of this image is a circular, inset photograph of a Dusky grouse. It has mottled camouflage pattern of brown, gray, white, and black on its back, with a dark gray tail and blue-gray underparts. It displays purplish-red air sacs on its neck, and a rich red eye comb. To the right is a second circular, inset photograph of a Kaibab squirrel. It has a black belly tinged with gray, a white tail, tufted ears, and a chestnut brown head. Moving down the center of the wayside, a second rectangular inset photograph shows a stand of tall, wide evergreen trees with dark green needles growing alongside additional, bushy evergreens with a rounded crown and many-forked trunks. A caption reads: Pinyon Pine – Utah Juniper 4,000–7,300 feet (1,200–2,230 m) Small conifers, or evergreens, growing with Gambel oak, cliffrose, and sagebrush. To the left of this image is a circular, inset photograph of a Scrub jay. Its head, wings, and tail are blue, with a gray underside. It has a white throat with a long tail and small bill. Continuing down the center of the wayside, a third rectangular inset photograph shows low, green plants hugging the rocky soil in the foreground. In the background, the similar vegetation covers the high rocky walls of the canyon. A caption reads: Desert Scrub 1,500–4,000 feet (450–1,200 m) Low growing, widely spaced shrubs and wildflowers, often dominated by blackbrush.

The road to Point Imperial leads north from the ‘Y’ nearly three miles (four and a half kilometers) to a one-way loop road at the point itself. At the far end of the loop road, to the right, a row of parallel car parking spaces faces a six-foot wide asphalt sidewalk. Larger recreational vehicles may parallel park at the left alongside a second sidewalk, beside a grove of trees with several picnic tables. Note there are vault toilets located at the far northern end of the picnic area. A wide concrete walkway leads to two pairs of gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible vault toilets at the left and right. Just beyond the open doorways to the toilets, note also there is a wildlife-proof garbage can, flanked by two recycling cans for plastic, glass, and aluminum. About two-thirds of the way around the parking lot loop to the right, opposite two wheelchair accessible parking spaces, a six-foot (two meter) wide asphalt path lined with small boulders leads east down a slight incline from the lot towards the point. At the head of the path to the left, a five-foot (one and a half meter) tall wooden sign stands before a roughly 30 foot (nine meter) wide dirt and gravel area under a stand of tall Ponderosa pine. Block capital letters read, “POINT IMPERIAL, ELV 8803” (2684 meters). About 30 feet straight ahead from the elevation sign, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail overlooks the rim to the east. Entitled, “Missing Layers,” it discusses why no dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in Grand Canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. To the left of the wayside panel, a wooden bench overlooks the rim. Note there are no guardrails between the bench and rim. To the left of the bench, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail overlooks the rim. Entitled “Grand Canyon Vista: Highest Viewpoint,” it discusses the very different view of the rock layers here. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. About 30 feet to the right of the elevation sign, note a second wooden bench in an open, dirt and gravel area behind a low, half-log wooden bench closer to the rim. Note there are no guardrails here, either. Continuing down the wheelchair accessible asphalt path towards the point, it first curves slightly left, then turns sharply back right down a slightly steeper incline along the rim’s edge to a flight of concrete stairs with metal handrails on either side. Eleven stairs lead halfway down to a concrete landing, followed by eleven more stairs to a concrete landing at the bottom of the staircase. Continuing forward from the landing, move onto the rough, rocky terrain of the roughly 30 foot long by 10 foot wide (nine by three meter) lookout area at Point Imperial. Note the entire area is surrounded by four-foot tall metal railings. From here at the most northern boundary of the park, visitors take in panoramic views of the Painted Desert and the eastern end of Grand Canyon and Vermilion Cliffs beyond. The canyon transforms from the narrow walls of Marble Canyon to a more open and dramatic \"grand\" canyon. Layers of red and black Precambrian rocks add contrast and color. Note at the far northern end of the parking lot, a wooden sign to the right of a dirt and gravel trail identifies the Point Imperial trail (5.4 miles roundtrip; 8.7 kilometers) that ends at the north park boundary. A second, smaller wooden sign shows the distances to the Saddle Mountain Trail (2.2 miles, 3.5 kilometers), and the Nankoweap Trail (5.2 miles, 8.4 kilometers). Note also at the far southern end of the lot, a 15-foot (five meter) wide, stone staircase leads down one step to a stone landing, then down three more stone steps to a dirt and gravel area and the beginning of the unpaved Ken Patrick Trail in a grove of trees. The 9.8 mile (15.8 kilometer) trail winds through the forest and along the rim to the North Kaibab Trail parking area. Sub-Script Missing Layers Wayside Panel A panoramic color vista of the canyon from Point Imperial fills the face of the panel. The Vermillion and Echo Cliffs are just visible far off in the distance, with the tall Kaibab limestone cliffs close in the foreground. Entitled “Missing Layers,” words at the top left read: In the distant view you can see the Mesozoic rocks of the Vermilion and Echo cliffs, where the nearest dinosaur fossils are found. No dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in Grand Canyon, but that does not mean dinosaurs never roamed here. Mesozoic rock layers—a mile (1.6 km) thick—once covered the canyon’s Kaibab Limestone layer, the rock where you are standing. When the Kaibab Plateau rose up 70–40 million years ago, the soft overlaying Mesozoic rock cracked, broke, and eroded away. Like hosing mud from a cement driveway, the Mesozoic rock vanished from the hard-surfaced Kaibab Limestone, washing away all evidence of dinosaurs. At the top right, additional red cliffs shown in two small inset color photographs are identified as Zion and Glen Canyon. A caption above reads: North of the Vermilion Cliffs in Utah are Zion, Capitol Reef, Glen Canyon, and Arches national park sites, all carved from Mesozoic rocks. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of a young boy facing us with his arms outstretched to the sides. Entitled, “Arms Span Time,” words next to a short, vertical white line by his fingertips at the left read, “Earth Forms.” Moving right, words next to a short, vertical white line by his right shoulder read, “Oldest Grand Canyon rocks.” By his thumb at the right, “Youngest Grand Canyon rocks.” At the base of his fingers, “Age of dinosaurs.” And finally by his fingertips at the far right, “Grand Canyon carved,” and “Today.” Grand Canyon Vista: Highest Viewpoint Wayside Panel A panoramic, labeled color vista of the canyon from this spot at Point Imperial fills the face of the panel. At the left there is the Marble Platform, Nankoweap Mesa, and the Colorado River (hidden), with the Supergroup rocks in the left foreground. The Desert Façade appears at the center left, and the much closer, pyramid-shaped Mt. Hayden at the right. Text at the top reads: As you look east from Point Imperial’s vista, you command the highest viewpoint in the park, at 8,803 feet (2,684 m). The view is very different here. There is no visible basement rock in the rock layers—the river has not cut that deeply yet. Prominent in the middle view are the Supergroup rocks, the middle rock layers of the canyon, often absent or obscured. The distant Marble Platform is a 2,700 foot (820 m) step down from Point Imperial. Though not visible in the view, as the raven flies, you are nearly seven miles (11 km) removed from the Colorado River. The river meanders its course more than a mile (1.6 km) below this elevation. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of the Washington Monument and Reflecting Pool. Text reads: Highest Vista, Biggest Drop You are at the highest viewpoint looking at the deepest view. Directly east is Nankoweap Mesa—the mesa topped with Limestone west of the Desert Facade. Behind this mesa is the river, some 6,000 feet (1,830 m) below us here – translated in Washington Monuments: that is 10 of them stacked end to end.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "3e41da5c-e993-436d-8f3c-1052ebdff17b", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Picnic Table", "Restroom", "Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Toilet - Vault/Composting", "Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Scenic Overlook", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [{"title": "Point Imperial", "id": "96F7917F-20C9-40A3-BE0E-EA8B2D721656", "type": "multimedia/galleries", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=6648881&id=96F7917F-20C9-40A3-BE0E-EA8B2D721656"}], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>—a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Backcountry Trail", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

He studied reports from earlier expeditions, but in the late 1800s there wasn't much to go on and most of what was available was inaccurate and jaded by the perceptions of early explorers. Gathering support and supplies from the Smithsonian Institution, railroads, educational institutions, and Congress for his expedition down the Green River. He designed his own boats and gathered a makeshift crew of ex-trappers, mountain men, and Civil War veterans like himself. The expedition launched four boats from Green River, Wyoming in May 24, 1869 to explore the course of the river, fill in the blank spots that littered maps of the southwest, and to gather scientific data.<br /> <br /> After three summer months spent exploring the upper canyons of the Colorado River, the expedition passed the Paria River on August 4 hungry, exhuasted both mentally and physically, and with only musty apples, spoiled bacon, wet flour, and coffee remaining to sustain them they entered the last and greatest of the canyons. The scientific expedition had turned into a fight for their very survival as they entered into Grand Canyon. Powell referred to Grand Canyon as “<em>our granite prison</em>” and described an almost unbroken series of rapids that the expedition ran, lined, or portaged, praying all the while for an end to the ordeal. On August 28, the canyon ended and the river became relatively quiet once again. They had survived, and in doing so became the first recorded people to successfully navigate from Green River, Wyoming to the Black Canyon of Arizona/Neveda.<br /> <br /> After a near disatrous first trip that cost Powell’s most of his notes and scientific data, a few boats, and multiple men, he secured full federal funding to a second trip. Powell gathered a new crew, this time including amateur scientists and educated men, and he began a second expedition on May 22, 1871. Between his two trips down the river Powell gathered invaulable information and data and literally helped to put Grand Canyon on a map. Further studies in the area over the next few years, by both Powell and his peers in the geologic community, helped to lay the foundation of how we understand Grand Canyon geology today. </p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "6498b627-1a05-4665-a67f-26cbf342b5b5", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Benches/Seating", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "South Rim", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Most people won't hike the whole trail in one go, but walking short sections of the rim can provide an excellent chance to stretch the legs after a long car ride, take a break from riding the shuttle, or to get away from a busy viewpoint for a moment. No matter how much of it you walk, you'll get lots of good views along the way!<br /> <br /> <strong>One-way Distances from Mather Point along the Rim Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> South Kaibab Trail - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum - 0.7 miles (1 km)<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Bright Angel Trailhead - 2.5 miles (4 km)<br /> Hermits Rest - 11 miles (18 km)</p> <h2>Popular Sections</h2> <h4>Mather Point to Yavapai Geology Museum</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 0.7 mi (1 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong>: </span>15–30 minutes<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. <br /> <br /> This short section of the trail is one of the most popular as it is easily accessible from both Mather and Yavapai Points and it offers constant views of Grand Canyon, as well as Phantom Ranch and a glimpse of the Colorado River far below. Even walking part of this section guarentees some great Grand Canyon vistas. <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Kaibab/Rim (Orange) Route shuttle bus is running to Mather Point and the Yavapai Geology Museum it links the two ends of this section for an easy one-way hike.  </p> <h4>Mather Point to Grand Canyon Historic Village</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 2.5 mi (4 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong></span>: 45 minutes to 2 hours<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibbility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. (It is largely downhill heading east to west from Mather to the Village)<br /> <br /> This 2.5 mile stretch of the Rim Trail includes the section above, and expands it west to include the trail to/from the historic village. While you can walk this section in under an hour it is recommended to plan for a longer trip as you'll want to take your time to appreciate all the good views, snag a few pictures, and experience the Trail of Time, which overlaps this section of the rim. The 2 mile (3.5 km) section between Yavapai Geology Museum and the Grand Canyon Historic Village can be hot and sunny in the summer time so be sure to take water, snacks, and sun protection. Water and restrooms are available at the Geology Museum, Grand Canyon Visitor and at multiple spots in the village. This section of the trail is quite popular as well, but offers more opportunities for solitude and quiet moments along the canyon's edge. <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Village (Blue) Route shuttle bus is running transportation will run between the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village to help complete a one-way loop. </p> <h4>Grand Canyon Historic Village to Hermits Rest</h4> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Length</span>: </strong>7 mi (11 km) one way<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Time:</span> </strong>3+ hours<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Accessibility:</span> </strong>The section between Monuement Creek Vista and Pima Point is paved and accessible, but the rest of the Rim Trail along the Hermit Road is <strong>NOT</strong> accessible. The rest of the trail is a mix of dirt and paved paths with the paved sections including steep grades and steps. <br /> <br /> The views along this section of the Rim Trail offer some of the best views of the Colorado River along the Hermit Road and can help get you away from the crowds at the major viewpoints along the way. There is limited water and restrooms availability along the Hermit Road so be prepared for longer hikes. Most hikers will use the shuttle system to jump along the road to do shorter sections of the trail and to return to the beginning of the scenic road. <i>Most</i> of the stops are about 1 mile from each other, though a few are longer, check your <strong>Pocket Map</strong> for a break down of the Rim Trail from point to point.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Hermit Rest (Red) Route shuttle bus is running it will stop at each of the major viewpoints and access points along the Rim Trail through this section. </p> <h4><span style=\"color:#cc0000;\">Safety - Hike Smart</span></h4> <p>- Take water, snacks, and sun protection with you on your hike. At 7,000 ft (2000 m) in elevation even a hike on the rim can leave you dehydrated, tired, and sun burnt. <br /> - Stay on designated trails and walkways and always keep a safe distance of at least six feet (2 m) from the edge of the canyon rim.<br /> - In areas where there is a railing or fence, do not climb over the barrier.<br /> - Know where the edge is. Watch foot placement and look for trip hazards.<br /> - Never throw rocks, coins, trash, or anything else over the edge.<br /> - Early summer temperatures can be HOT. Highs will often reach the low to mid 90s <sup>o</sup>F (...<sup>o</sup>C) and even the canyon rim can reach temperatures above 100<sup>o</sup>F (38<sup>o</sup>C). Check the weather and be prepared.<br /> - The late summer season brings rain and thunderstorms to Grand Canyon. Remember, \"If it roars, Go indoors\". Lightning can and often does strike the edge of the canyon as thunderstorms pass over the area. </p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Benches/Seating", "Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

He is also said to have rode a mule down the Bright Angel Trail in 1903 to tell the Havasupai people they had to leave their home, now Indian Garden, to create a National Park.<br /> <br /> During his first visit to Grand Canyon in May 1903, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed, \"Leave it as it is. You cannot improve upon it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.\"<br /> <br /> On June 8, 1906, Roosevelt signed into legislation the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a> , which enabled the President \"...to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments..\"<br /> <br /> On January 11, 1908, Roosevelt officially recognized the significance of Grand Canyon by using this same order to proclaim it a national monument. In 1919, three years after the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, it was officially designated as a national park.<br /> <br /> In his time as President of the United States, â€˜Teddy' used his authority to protect wildlife and public lands in unprecedented fashion. He created the United States Forest Service (USFS) in 1905 and established 150 national forests. In addition, Roosevelt also authorized the creation of 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments under the Antiquities Act. In total, Theodore Roosevelt protected approximately 230 million acres of public land.<br /> <br /> Today, the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, both positive and negative, is found across the country. There are six national park sites dedicated, in part or whole, to our conservationist president. You can find more information about these places, including North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park, under these <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-related-web-sites.htm\">related websites</a> .</p>", "audioDescription": "A D Stop 5, Roosevelt Point. 2 ¼ minutes. Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, just under two miles (three kilometers) beyond Vista Encantada, a small pullout to the left leads to a one-lane parking area. A three-foot (one meter) wide asphalt sidewalk runs along the side of the road on the canyon side. In the center of the sidewalk, a paved central path leads east to a large boulder at the right with a roughly two foot (60 cm) square metal plaque affixed to its front. At the top left of the plaque is a three-dimensional image of Theodore Roosevelt with a bushy mustache and eyebrows, wearing a monocle. Text on the plaque reads: ROOSEVELT POINT Named in honor of the 26th President of the United States for his efforts towards the preservation of the Grand Canyon. A 1903 quote on the plaque by Theodore Roosevelt reads: Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it. What you can do is keep it for your children, for your children’s children, and for all that come after you, as the one great sight which every American … should see. Moving about 20 feet (six meters) past the boulder, down a slight incline, the paved path leads past a wooden bench at the right, ending at a narrow dirt and gravel border in front of a line of boulders along the rim. Note there is also a small, wood-covered shelter set over the boulders to the right. To the left of the central path, a wayside panel mounted on a three-foot (one meter) tall angled, metal reading rail along the line of boulders talks about how the uplift of the Kaibab Plateau 70 million years ago created the highest elevations in Grand Canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. At the north end of the small roadside parking area, a short trail leads downhill to several wooden benches at the Roosevelt Point viewpoint. The upper end of a long, thin ridge extends four miles (six and a half kilometers) eastwards, descending several thousand feet in a series of mesas and buttes. Sub-Script Big Step Down Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon from Roosevelt Point fills the face of the panel. Entitled “Big Step Down,” words at the top left read: Looking east from Roosevelt Point, the opposite side of Grand Canyon lies far below. This entire region, 75 million years ago, was a smooth plain stretching off to the east. About five million years later, that landscape began to change. North America drifted westward, squeezing the western landscape, and the land began to rise. Far to the east, the Rocky Mountains folded and buckled skyward. Here, on the Colorado Plateau, the uplift was smoother. Even so, the Kaibab Plateau where you stand was pushed about 2,400 feet (732 m) higher than the Marble Platform to the east, creating a big step down. In the center of the panel, a white circle surrounds a portion of the Marble Platform far off in the distance, with a white line connecting to a circular, inset color photograph of that location. In the photograph, a clearly identifiable fault line runs between steep, rocky walls. A caption reads: Sharp eyes or binoculars help you spot the fault line separating the Kaibab Plateau from the Marble Platform. Here the normally flat rock layers of the canyon were bent upward, showing where the big step rose vertically over the Butte Fault. Text at the lower left of the panel reads: The uplift of the Kaibab Plateau 70 million years ago created the highest elevations in Grand Canyon. Here, at Roosevelt Point, we stand 2,400 feet (732 m) above Marble Platform and more than 8,400 feet (2,560 m) above sea level.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "8b9960e9-c1c3-4b28-93e8-62dd0f75ddcc", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Scenic Overlook", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Representatives from Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant services comprised the Corporation. The National Park Service approved it because it offered the opportunity for all religious faiths to have a place of worship. The idea was to build a permanent building near a site on the canyon rim already used for services, including a very popular Easter Sunrise service.<br /> <br /> Harold E. Wagoner, a member of the board of directors of the Church Architectural Guild of America, was selected as architect. Working within National Park Service guidelines to respect the natural environment and American Indian culture, he designed a structure that reflected the architectural style of a kiva, a place of worship used by native people in the Southwest. This design worked well since the National Park Service also required that no towers or specific religious symbols be used.<br /> <br /> Because the initial building site was on the rim of the canyon just west of today's Hermits Rest Route (red) shuttle stop, plans called for the main auditorium to have a sweeping canyon view from a multi-story, curved window placed behind the altar. A special hydraulic lift would raise and lower at least three different altar configurations for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant services. An organ placed on a small balcony, with wind chests and pipes located at different sections of the main chapel, would provide stereophonic sound effects.<br /> <br /> Even as fundraising efforts reached around the world, questions about whether the rim was an appropriate location for the structure resulted in delays. Some even argued that the building only remotely resembled a kiva, instead looking more like a huge spacecraft perched on the canyon rim. Donations were never quite enough to realize Wagoner's plans, and federal funding became involved. The building was ultimately redesigned and relocated away from the edge of the canyon. An appropriate site was chosen next to the existing Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, and Shrine of the Ages was completed by 1970.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service took over ownership of the building in 1975, along with all maintenance, operational, and administrative duties.</p>", "audioDescription": "The Shrine of the Ages is a one-story building with limestone rubble walls that rise up and away from a central entranceway filled with three 20-foot (6 m) tall by 30-foot (9 m) wide towering T-shaped wooden arches. A couple ponderosa pine trees grow in the outdoor courtyard between the arches. Inside, a 250-plus seat auditorium with a large, multi-paned trapezoidal window wall is used by the National Park Service, Grand Canyon Conservancy, and others, and can also be rented for private functions. In the winter months, the nightly Evening Program is held inside the Shrine of the Ages, offering the opportunity to learn about a variety of Grand Canyon resources. Park rangers may discuss geology, human history, wildlife, the night sky, water resources, rock art, canyon hiking, and more. Special events, such as concerts or demonstrations, may take the place of a park ranger program allowing visiting artists, musicians, or students opportunities to present programs to the community and the general public.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "c2458965-5beb-46e6-b526-c74b49ddd68c", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Amphitheater", "Bicycle - Rack", "Parking - Auto", "Picnic Table", "Restroom", "Restroom - Accessible", "Water - Drinking/Potable", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Near Park Headquarters and Market Plaza", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Auditorium", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [{"title": "Shrine of The Ages", "id": "D82D8056-14C0-4A2E-9C77-7B568D7FFE6A", "type": "multimedia/galleries", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=6644988&id=D82D8056-14C0-4A2E-9C77-7B568D7FFE6A"}], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

This can be a great trail for short trips into the canyon of half a day or less, but the openness of this trail lends itself to extreme heat during the summer months and little to no protection from passing storms.<br /> <br /> There is little shade, and what is there comes mostly from the canyon walls at the very beginning of the trail in the early part of day.<br /> <br /> There is <b>no water</b> along the trail, though there is a spring-fed water filling station at the trailhead during the summer.<br /> <br /> <b>No private vehicles allowed at the trailhead. Access is by foot, bicycle, or shuttle bus only.</b><br /> <br /> *Note: all trails into the canyon are steep and difficult; consider contacting a park ranger before starting your hike.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>Ooh Aah Point</strong><br /> 1.8 miles (2.9 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 1-2 hours / 790 feet (230 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Cedar Ridge</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,120 feet (340 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Skeleton Point </strong>- Check with a park ranger before attempting as a day hike.<br /> 6 miles (9.6 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 2,040 feet (620 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking below Skeleton Point is not recommended as a day hike due to the long distance, extreme temperature changes, and an approximately 5,000-foot (1,500 m) elevation change each way. Consult a park ranger before heading further down for safety tips and overnight permits.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>The Tipoff</strong><br /> 9 miles (14.5 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 3,280 feet (1,100 m) elevation change<br /> <strong>NOTE: The South Kaibab Trail is CLOSED between the Tipoff and the Colorado River/Black Bridge (updated August 20, 2025). </strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Phantom Ranch (CLOSED)</strong><br /> 15 miles (24 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2 days / 4,700 ft (1,430 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>There is no water on the South Kaibab Trail. From early May to mid-October there is water near the trailhead (from a spigot near the bus stop). Potable water is available year round at Bright Angel Campground, however, please note that due to occasional pipeline breaks water at Bright Angel Campground is not guaranteed: bringing an alternative form of water treatment, such as iodine tablets or a water filter, is essential. During hot weather, take at least 4 liters of water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Hikers seeking panoramic views unparalleled on any other trail at Grand Canyon will want to consider a hike down the South Kaibab Trail. It is the only trail at Grand Canyon National Park that so dramatically holds true to a ridgeline descent. But this exhilarating sense of exposure to the vastness of the canyon comes at a cost: there is little shade and no water for the length of this trail.<br /> <br /> During winter months, the constant sun exposure is likely to keep most of the trail relatively free of ice and snow. For those who insist on hiking during summer months, which is not recommended in general, this trail is the quickest way to the bottom (it has been described as \"a trail in a hurry to get to the river\"), but due to lack of any water sources, ascending the trail can be a dangerous proposition.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>Hikers must use the park's free shuttle bus system to reach the trailhead. Every morning, three hiker express buses leave from the Bright Angel Lodge and then from the Backcountry Information Center (times vary depending on the month). Otherwise, hikers will need to park at Grand Canyon Visitor Center and take the South Kaibab (Orange) shuttle bus.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and the death to mules.

It ranks as <b>one of the most difficult and demanding developed trails</b> in the park.<br /> <br /> The Tanner Trail is <b>steep</b>, <b>rarely maintained</b>, and <b>not a recommended first hike into the canyon</b>. The only source of water is at the Colorado River. In general, Grand Canyon is infamous for summer heat and the Tanner Trail is noted for being unusually hot.<br /> <br /> The summer sun rises early and sets late in this wide-open area. The absence of water produces sparse vegetation and little shade. River runners call this part of the Grand Canyon \"Furnace Flats\".<br /> <br /> Avoid this trail during warm/hot weather over 95°F (35°C).</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p><strong>Strongly consider talking with a park ranger before attempting this hike.</strong><br /> <br /> The trail is <strong>steep</strong> and <strong>no water is available until the river</strong>. Expect to hike and climb over unstable footpaths and boulder fields. Your best option for a day hike would be to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. To reach just this point, be prepared for 1.6 miles (2.6 km) over a descent of 1,700 feet (518 m). Hiking beyond the 75 Mile Creek Saddle is exposed and can be extremely hot.<br /> <br /> There are no water sources along the trail until the Colorado River, a 9 mile trek (14.5 km) and elevation change of 4,650 feet (1,417 m) each way. The elevation at Lipan Point is 7,350 feet (2,240 m) and at the Colorado River it is 2,700 feet (823 m). However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult and time-consuming to purify.<br /> <br /> If you choose to hike down what remains of a pioneer-era trail, you will head immediately down the gully east of Lipan Point. The upper section of the Tanner Trail is narrow, badly eroded, and can be difficult to follow, especially after a storm. The trail stays on the slopes east of the bottom of the gully through the Toroweap Formation and switches to the west side at the top of the Coconino Sandstone. Rockslides in the Coconino Sandstone have covered the original trail in places, forcing hikers to improvise short sections. The trail descends steeply across the slope west of the bed of gully nearly all the way to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. A prime canyon view at the saddle is the reward for a couple of miles of notably unstable hiking. The reward comes with a price - hiking out of the canyon from even here is one of the more rugged, steeper climbs in the park.<br /> <br /> Hiking beyond this point requires detailed planning and experience hiking in a desert environment.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>The Colorado River is the sole source of water. No reliable water exists above the shoreline. The Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult to purify under those conditions.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>Parking is available at Lipan Point. Walk back down the road a short ways and look for the trailhead, east of the pavement.<br /> <br /> It is 9 miles (14.5 km) from Lipan Point at 7,350 feet (2,240 m) to the Colorado River down at 2,700 feet (823 m).  All water should be treated or boiled. However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult to purify.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>The lower reaches of Grand Canyon below Desert View are dominated by a series of tilted layers of stone known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. The Supergroup is a complex collection of ancient sedimentary and igneous rocks ranging in age from 729 million to 1.255 billion years, the oldest sedimentary deposits in the canyon. The colorful rocks are soft and easily eroded so the canyon floor is unusually expansive, offering unimpeded views of some of the steepest walls to be found below the rim.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>American Indians used this natural rim-to-river route for several thousand years. The trail as we know it today has been in use since 1890, when Franklin French and Seth Tanner improved it. This work allowed early miners access to their claims; it was also used as the southern component of the disreputable Horsethief Route.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for backcountry camping in this area. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website</a> or request permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> As part of conservation efforts to salvage plant and animal habitats that depend upon remnants of older pre-dam sediments near the Colorado River, <strong>the large sand dune at the mouth of Tanner Canyon is closed to visitation and camping</strong>. <strong>Tanner Canyon use area (BB9) is the only exception</strong> , allowing \"at-large\" camping. There are nice (although dry) established campsites along the trail at Seventyfive Mile Creek-Tanner Canyon saddle, trailside in the Supai Formation, above and below the Redwall Limestone, and in the Tapeats Sandstone. Campsites near the Colorado River can be found on the east side of Tanner Canyon. A composting toilet is nearby.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Desert View Quad (USGS)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)</p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "18d1a9fd-3f0b-4b24-af9b-89e150b177fb", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Information", "Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Desert View Drive", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Several factors are linked to this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> <b>Wildfire</b> has certainly played a role.<br /> <br /> <b>Drainage</b> is also a limiting factor. Trees are skilled at soaking up water, though seedlings may have a hard time growing in locations exposed to greater amounts of sun, rain, and snow.<br /> <br /> <b>Soil chemistry</b> is also a consideration. Natural toxins and higher alkaline concentrations can prevent the growth of woody plants.<br /> <br /> <b>Competition</b> is significant. For example, Ponderosa pine trees struggle to grow in areas dominated by established grasses. <b>Variations in bedrock</b> (primarily Kaibab limestone) may also affect how deep or suitable an area is for seedling growth. And grazing <b>wildlife</b>, like mule deer and bison, keep vegetation low and trimmed.<br /> <br /> You can also observe this phenomenon along the beginning of Cape Royal Road, here on the North Rim.</p> <h3>Bison Safety</h3> <ul> <li>Bison are wild animals and are unpredictable.</li> <li>Maintain a distance of 100 feet (30 m) from bison.</li> <li>When the bison are within 100 feet (30 m) of the road, it is recommended to view wildlife from inside a vehicle.</li> <li>Please use established gravel or paved pull-outs to park vehicles completely off the roadway (all wheels right of the white line).

The first train arrived in 1901, bringing passengers ready to marvel at Grand Canyon's one-of-a-kind views. Today this feeling continues as folks step off the train, eager to make the walk up towards El Tovar Hotel and the canyon rim.<br /> <br /> Constructed in 1909-1910, the Train Depot is part of the Grand Canyon National Park National Historic Landscape District and a designated National Historic Landmark. Designed by architect Francis W. Wilson of Santa Barbara, California, the log and wood-frame structure is two stories high.<br /> <br /> Originally, the downstairs was designated for station facilities and the station agent's family inhabited the upstairs. Today, the first floor is used for railway passenger services. The building is one of 14 log depots constructed in the United States and one of only three remaining. Of the three, the Train Depot is the only one in which logs were used as the primary structural material and which still serves an operating railroad. The depot's logs are squared on three sides creating bearing surfaces, flat interior surfaces, and a rustic exterior appearance.<br /> <br /> Just beyond the depot is the El Tovar Hotel, built in 1905 by the Santa Fe Railroad. The structure is the signature hotel along the rim. The railroad built the Train Depot five years after the hotel and placed it conveniently close for the rail passengers.</p>", "audioDescription": "Grand Canyon Railway Depot sits at the end of the railroad tracks down the hill from El Tovar. The main facade faces south, away from the canyon.<br />The 3,000-square foot (900 square meter) log structure is primarily a one-story building with a broad, moderately-pitched gable roof with the ridge running on the long axis, parallel to the four sets of train tracks, thirty feet (9 m) across. A frame second story occupies the center third of the building, sheathed with flush planking framed by vertical log posts. This central portion is covered with another broad gabled roof at right angles to the main roof. The second story overhangs the first, supported by heavy vertical log posts, and an attic overhangs the second story, supported by log brackets. An extension of the main roof to the west at a slightly lower elevation shelters a large two-bay porch, supported on vertical log posts, and a small one-story bay projects slightly from the central block. Note there is a set of men's restrooms outside on the back-north side of the building, towards the east.<br />Inside, there are four main rooms. From west to east there is a ticket office-waiting room with several wooden benches and metal railings, an agent's office, a parcel storage room and a baggage room. Family and women's restrooms are between these rooms and the platform. Interior walls are plastered with log-slab wainscoting. Note that much of the original hardware is present. Feel the doorknobs, stamped with the letters, \"GC.\"<br />Back outside, there are a couple picnic tables underneath a tree to the east of the station next to the tracks.<br /><br />On the south side of the depot, just east of the large two-bay porch, an old black-and-white picture of the train station fills the top of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top left reads:<br />\"Grand Canyon Depot <br />In 1901, the screech of train brakes and the blast of a train whistle signaled the arrival of a new era in Grand Canyon Village. The railroad provided the most comfortable means of transportation to the canyon for more than a quarter century. This log depot, finished in 1910, welcomed train passengers to a growing village. By 1924, a community development plan was created for the village. Almost a century later, that planned community forms the core of Grand Canyon Village, centering on the last operational log depot in the country. Today, the depot is carefully preserved and still welcomes passengers to the canyon.\"<br />A smaller black-and-white picture at the lower left shows a black steam engine trailed by several cars next to a small wooden structure at the left. A caption reads:<br />\"The original depot was a small shack located west of here. The need for a larger, more sophisticated structure quickly became apparent.\"<br />Two more black-and-white photos along the right side of the panel show long lines of a half-dozen trains in front of the depot, and a parking lot full of vintage cars next to the tracks. A caption reads:<br />These photos depict a thriving Grand Canyon rail operation, but with the opening of the paved automotive highway from Williams, Arizona, in 1926, that began to change. Ridership declined for decades. Finally, in 1968, the passenger service and depot closed.<br />A color photograph at the bottom right shows a black steam engine and coal car with several trailing cars in front of the station. Another caption reads:<br />\"In 1989, passenger service resumed, bringing thousands of visitors to Grand Canyon by rail each year. Traveling this way lessens auto congestion on traffic-busy park roads.\"<br /><br />On the south side of the depot, beside two large logs in the middle of the two-bay porch, is an 18-inch (46 cm) square metal plaque mounted on an angle to the top of a four-foot (1.2 m) tall wooden pedestal. Text on the plaque reads:<br />\"Grand Canyon Railway Depot has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

To the right is a small brown metal box with a slanted and hinged metal lid on a three-foot (1 m) tall rectangular metal post. Text on the panel reads: Tusayan Ruin Trail Allow about 30 minutes to tour Tusayan Ruin. The 0.1-mile loop trail through the main ruin is paved and wheelchair-accessible; the side loop to a prehistoric farming site is not. Signs along the way explain the site's features. An interpretive trail guide with greater detail about Tusayan's inhabitants is available to your right. Tusayan Ruin is a remnant of a small village of about 20 people who lived here for 25 to 30 years in the late 1100s. The architecture was typical for that period. Pueblo architecture varies according to availability of local materials. Here, builders used limestone blocks held together with mud. The name \"Tusayan\" was the Spanish name for this geographic area, and was given to the ruin by archeologists who excavated the site in 1930. A color illustration fills the right-hand side of the panel, showing dozens of men, women, and children around a rectangular, one-story stone structure. Wooden posts stick out along the roof line, and long wooden ladders protrude out of several square holes in the top. A smooth-walled, one-story circular structure with a rocky base sits in a clearing behind the first building. A wooden ladder sticks up from a single square hole in the center of the roof.

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32Â°F (0Â°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Before it was a park, Grand Canyon was set aside and managed as a Game Reserve by the USFS in 1906. At that time, the wildlife management plan sought to protect grazing animals by removing the predators.<br /> <br /> James T. \"Uncle Jim\" Owens was a warden for the US Forest Service (USFS) who lived in a cabin on the rim while carrying out his duties in the reserve. Uncle Jim is credited with killing 532 mountain lions from the North Rim.</p>", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "0", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "90488180-fd9e-4265-90fd-e619d41d5d39", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Hiking Trail", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Profits proved meager, so John sold his inventory to the Bright Angel Hotel and closed his shop. Returning in 1905, John built the permanent store you see today. His business prospered; indeed, it was his only business to survive the Great Depression. In 1936, John, his wife, and their four children moved into the apartment above the store. John managed the store until his death in 1944. His children, and eventually his grandchildren, operated the store. When it closed in 2008, it was the last echo of the canyon's pioneer businesses.\" A caption underneath the photograph reads: \"Verkamp hired El Tovar architect Charles F.

Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, about six and a half miles (10 kilometers) past Roosevelt Point, a pullout to the left leads to a one-lane road beside the Walhalla Overlook, with parking on either side. Note a small wood and stone bench shelter and a wildlife-proof garbage can at the head (north end) of the lot. A five foot (two meter) wide asphalt sidewalk stretches over 500 feet (150 meters) south between the parking lane curb and a line of boulders at the edge of the canyon. About 150 feet (45 meters) along the sidewalk, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail tells the story of Puebloan farmers who once made the journey from river to rim on a routine basis. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. At this location, far below us, the Unkar Creek has carved a wide swath of rocky walls and sloping banks that open up to a panorama of the canyon floor and Unkar Delta. Fifteen miles (24 kilometers) in the distance, the walls of the South Rim rise steeply to a flat, desert plain. Much closer, off to the right, just beyond the point at Cape Royal, Vishnu Temple rises 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) into the air, topped with a pyramid-like limestone caprock. Sub-Script Living Delta to Rim Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon from Walhalla Overlook fills the face of the panel. Entitled “Living Delta to Rim,” words at the top of the panel read: From the North Rim, the Colorado River and the Unkar Delta below seem distant, yet ancestral Puebloan farmers 1,100 to 800 years ago made the journey from river to rim on a routine basis, spending summers on the rim and most of the remainder of the year within the canyon. For nearly five generations (about 100 years) farmers moved between Unkar Delta and Walhalla Glades, their summer home (across the road behind you). They successfully planted crops along the river, near water sources in side canyons, and on the North Rim. Corn, beans, and squash were their principle crops, but they also supplemented their diet with wild game, leafy plants, roots, nuts, and berries. The stone foundations of their dwellings, along with the artifacts left behind, tell stories of vibrant communities living in the harsh canyon environment. At the left, a white line from the Unkar Delta, far below in the center of the panel, connects to a circular inset photograph of rows of rocks arranged in neat squares and rectangles on the ground. A caption reads: Archaeologists can still piece together the stories of Unkar Delta’s ancient farming communities, even though floods have washed much of the evidence away. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of more low, interconnected stone walls in a grove of trees. Text reads: Camp Walhalla Glades If you have been to summer camp, you probably traveled there by car or bus. Ancestral Puebloan children walked and climbed miles to their summer camp (across the road behind you), called Walhalla Glades. Find their winter home in the view and see if you can plot a route the children might have followed to camp.  ", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "c4384988-5017-413a-a795-41b18a946763", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim - Cape Royal Road", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Scenic Overlook", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>,<strong> </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>The trail is named after Gunnar Widforss, an early twentieth-century artist from Sweden. He lived and painted at the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, producing a large collection of watercolors prized for their geologic detail. Widforss tried to capture the Grand Canyon environment as he saw it then. That environment has changed over the years as natural and human forces continue to reshape a picture characterized by monumental change through the eons. The geologic features, plant life, and historic features along this trail all provide glimpses of these past and present environments-and future ones as well.<br /> <br /> Previously, Widforss Point had been called McKinnon Point. Colonel H. McKinnon, a British visitor, stopped here in 1892 after a successful hunting trip on the Kaibab Plateau with W.S. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. He left a note in a tin can at the point to commemorate his triumph.</p>", "audioDescription": "A D Stop 13, North Rim Forest - Wayside. ¾ minute. About four miles (six point four kilometers) south of the North Rim Entrance Station, the North Rim Picnic Area is located in a small pullout along the east side of Highway 67. A number of picnic tables sit on the west side of the tarmac. On the east side of the pullout, a wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail stands in a grassy area before a grove of trees. Entitled “The North Rim Forest,” the wayside discusses the marked differences of the forest here compared to that of the South Rim. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. Note a pair of wildlife-proof, metal garbage cans to the right of the wayside. Sub-Script The North Rim Forest Wayside Panel A color photograph of a stand of tall, slender trees with light-colored bark and yellow leaves fills the lower left half of the panel. At the top left, words read: The North Rim Forest The forest that you see here differs markedly from that on the South Rim. The ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper forest common on the South Rim, and at lower elevations of the North Rim, gives way at higher elevations to the spruce-fir forest you see here. The differences in forest composition are primarily the result of increased moisture at these higher elevations. The South Rim, 7000 feet (2134 meters) above sea level, receives about 15 inches (38 centimeters) of precipitation each year. The spruce-fir forest here on the North Rim, between 8200 and 9200 feet (between 2500 and 2800 meters) above sea level, averages 25 inches (nearly 64 centimeters) a year. Much of that comes as snow. Three smaller color photographs fill the right side of the panel. The top two show the slender white tree trunks and circular yellow and green leaves of the Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). At the lower right, a bushy evergreen is identified in a caption as a Blue spruce (Picea pungens). A list to the left of the bottom photograph reads: Trees characteristic of the North Rim forest include: Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) blue spruce (Picea pungens) white fir (Abies concolor) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "0", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Restroom", "Trailhead"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "North Rim", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Hiking Trail to Scenic Overlook", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

The structure's exterior walls and foundation are made of uniformly-sized, native Kaibab Formation boulders with buttressed corners which give the building a rich variation in form, texture, and line. The building has a low, flat asphalt roof, timber beams, and protruding wood rafters. Other rustic characteristics include small window openings, and timber doors. The splayed courses of the building merge into the surrounding curbing and paving stones. Inside, a vast 3,000 square foot (900 square meter) room houses a wide variety of geology exhibits that showcase the canyon's history, including a scale model of Grand Canyon, samples of its geologic layers, plant and animal fossils, specimens of modern flora and fauna common to the region, and maps and charts for public use. The entire north wall is covered with a series of five 10-foot (3 m) wide by five-foot (1.5 m) tall windows with sweeping views of the North Rim, the inner canyon, and the Colorado River far below. A variety of interpretive displays explain the deposition of the canyon's strata, the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, and the role of the Colorado River in carving Grand Canyon over time. These exhibits are augmented by daily interpretive talks conducted by National Park Service park rangers about Grand Canyon's geologic history.
