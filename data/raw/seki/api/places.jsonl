The narrow-pointed tops belong to younger sequoias. The text reads, The canopy of leaves cloaking the Giant Forest covers the work of a dramatic change agent- fire. Fire has shaped every sequoia you see. Young trees grow tall fast to rise above the low flames that typically burn here. Then they put on thick bark, which protects them from most fire. Black scars on sequoia trunks reveal the trees' ability to survive. If today's view includes smoke from the park fire, this may be a good day for the sequoias grove. Flames clear forest litter and fertilize the soil, prompt cones to release seeds, and open the forest to the sun. This creates the ideal seedbed for sequoias. Other trees and wildlife benefit from the fires affects, as well. A photo of your left view from this location shows a robust green forest with tree tops of various shapes and sizes. Mountain tops line the view in the distance. The caption reads, Look to your left for this view of treetops of the Giant Forest. The tallest round crowns are mature sequoias.

An inset photo shows a park firefighter walking through patches of fire and billowing smoke, on the forest floor in a grove of Sequoia trees. He wears a backpack and a yellow helmet and shirt, and holds a metal canister with a flame coming out of the nozzle. The grove includes a very large sequoia trunk, with two large burn scars, almost 10 feet high. There are also a few fallen tree trunks, about one foot in diameter, and a few charred stumps.

The cones are about the size of an egg, with a small twig attached to each. The cones have been flattened on the bottom to help secure them to the frames. Many wayside exhibits in the Giant Forest have similar brass cones. The text reads, A Graceful Grouping Known as The Three Graces, these three sequoia trees are all the same age. How did they come to stand in such an orderly row? At some time in the past, a large tree probably fell here. In falling, it may have torn an opening in the forest canopy, letting sunlight hit the ground. Eventually one of the frequent natural fires here burned it up. Sequoia seeds sprout in huge numbers after fire. They grow particularly well where it burns hot enough to leave nothing but ash and bare soil. They survive even better where sunlight also reaches them. A row of ash left by the burned trunk of a tree that opened the forest as it fell would be the perfect spot. A black and white photo shows three giant sequoias, touched by shafts of sunlight that also illuminate the dirt road beside them.

Two photos of other in line Sequoias. A photo of four sequoias in a line with two dirt roads, each of which runs in between the trees on the left side of the grouping.

Thick insulating bark protects mature sequoias from all but the hottest flames. The Tennessee Tree before you has burned more dramatically than many, yet it still survives. How? Sequoia wood is high in tannin, a chemical that helps exposed wood to resist rot and insects. Where bark remains, nutrients can still flow. Look up to see how much of this tough tree lives on. A photo shows the ground next to a sequoia tree trunk. It is thickly covered with pine needles and small branches. The text reads, Sequoias depend on fire. Fire clears leaf litter away and opens the cones, allowing seeds to reach the bare mineral soil they need to grow. A photo shows a bright green young seedling sprouting up from darkened soil with patches of white ash. The text reads, Wildfires create open spaces where sunlight can reach the forest floor. Young trees in these clearings get abundant sunlight, water, and nutrients. On the right side of this exhibit is a photo of a sequoia tree trunk, engulfed in flames. Smoke billows around the tree.

This wayside exhibit, titled \"Berries, Bees, and Snow\", shows how wildlife depends on manzanita plant flowers and berries. The View: Behind this wayside exhibit, within easy reach from the sidewalk, is a Manzanita bush, 2 to 3 feet high. Depending on the season of your visit you can touch its leaves and feel for berries. But use care, as there are often bees around this bush. The area around you has covered picnic benches and paved paths. The text on the panel reads, The greenleaf manzanita before you is a berry making machine, well adapted to the local pattern of snowy winters and dry summers. In fall, many animals rely on its berries. But timing and amount of this prize food may be at risk, because climate change affects not only snow but bees. If snowfall changes or bees arrive at the wrong time, fewer berries may appear and maybe not when wildlife needs them most. Help scientist track changes to this essential plant and the ecosystem that relies on it. Take photos using the nearby picture post. A photo of a black bear, standing amid bushes with bright green oval leaves. The bear is covered with black fur, with a tan muzzle, black nose, and large round ears. The caption reads, In late summer and fall, bears gorge on berries to fatten for winter. Many other mammals, birds, and insects also depend on manzanita, Spanish for little apples. A photo shows a black textured clump with tan colored nuts mixed in it, on the ground. The caption reads, Black bear scat (or poop) loaded with manzanita berry seeds. Four photos of a manzanita branch with oval pointed leaves show how it looks during each season. Simple graphic icons illustrate weather conditions. From left to right, Winter Snow (with two snowflake icons): leaves with tiny green clusters are partly covered by snow. The caption reads, Snow cover protects dormant berry buds from winds and hard freezes. Warmer winter mean less snow, which threatens survival of buds. Springtime Buds (with two raindrop icons): A cluster of pink bulb shaped flowers. The caption reads, As roots absorb melting snow, pink buds appear. With warmth and moisture, buds become small white or pink flowers. Summer Pollination (with a sun icon): A bee is inside the flower cluster. The caption reads, Buzz pollination makes berries possible. Bees beat their wings to shake pollen from flowers, which fertilizes seeds. Listen for manzanitas buzzing with bees. Autumn Harvest (with a single raindrop icon): A cluster of bright red berries.

The View: Continue along this short dirt path through a conifer forest, several hundred feet to a giant sequoia tree stump. The stump stands about 5 feet tall. The top has been cut away and you can climb up a few wooden stairs to the top. The top surface is uneven and there are no safety rails. Once on top, one can see how the trunk's deep layers of tree growth radiate out in concentric layers, like a cut onion. You can also walk around the base of the stump, to discover how truly huge this tree was. On the wayside is a photo of this forest, in 1891. A few large sequoias are surrounded by sparse younger trees. A giant sequoia tilts dramatically. The cut on the right side of its base is wedge shaped. The caption explains that a photographer shot this sequoia mid-fall, and that the forest around you has regenerated since then. The text reads, The Mark Twain Stump in front of you has a unique story to tell. In 1891, while lumbermen were cutting other sequoia trees for grapevine stakes, lumber, and shake shingles, the Mark Twain Tree was selected for another fate, world fame. The American Museum of Natural History in New York City wanted a cross section of a giant sequoia for display. The Mark Twain Tree was chosen to provide the slab. Through this huge tree's sacrifice, many people far from California could marvel at the immensity of sequoias. Some vowed to preserve the remaining giants as living, growing monuments. At the top left is a historic photo of a woman, in a long dark dress, posing in a line with four children and a man with a beard, in front of a giant sequoia that is twice as wide as their group. This is the Ben Hicks family at the still standing Mark Twain Tree in the 1880s. The tree was nearly 300 feet (or 91.4 meters) tall and was 91 feet (or 27.7 meters) around at the base. A photo of the trunk of the tree, with a deep gouge on the right side, and a large pile of wood chips. Two lumberjacks chop and saw inside the cut. It took 13 days to bring the tree down.

The branches of young sequoias give them the cone shape of most other conifer trees, like a Christmas tree. Mature sequoias, however, have trunks that become much bigger than the branches. Branches only start about halfway up the trunk. Mature sequoias, called monarchs, are nature's skyscrapers. Trying to glimpse their tippy tops could give you a sore neck. Their trunks are reddish brown, with thick layers of deeply furrowed bark that is soft and fibrous on the surface, like shredded wheat cereal. Some trunks have dark, indented triangular scars, caused by fire. The forest floor is covered with a thick, soft carpet of pine needles. Around large sequoias, the ground is also covered with thin strips of bark that have shredded away from the tree trunks. The forest creates a rich habitat for a large variety of wildlife, including black bears, mule deer, chickarees, and gray squirrels. Depending upon the season, you may also hear the sounds of forest birds: ravens, nuthatches, and Steller's jays. As the seasons change, so does the look of the forest.

If you run your hands over the leaves, you can smell the fresh scent. There is a brown wooden building with peaked roofs and long wood planks on the outer walls. It has a double door on the end closest to the parking area with a wooden sign with white lettering over it that reads, \"Gift Shop\". The wall that faces the river has a door at the far left side, and two windows on the right, with a ledge the runs below them.

The U.S. Cavalry. Every summer from 1891 to 1913, mounted troops guarded these parks. They rode almost 300 miles from their post at the San Francisco Presidio. The cavalry's duel task of guarding the parks and assisting visitors came with little instruction or funding.

Their green canopy provides welcome shade. The text explains that the road to Moro Rock is part of the legacy of America's first black national park superintendent. Captain Charles Young, a West Point graduate, commanded the cavalry units of Buffalo Soldiers who were assigned here in 1903. Before there were park rangers, the military guarded national parks. Young's troops were the first African-Americans to do so. In just one summer, he and his men completed many projects. They took some of the first vital steps towards long- term protection of this park. Captain Young later earned the rank of Colonel, and became a national figure. A sequoia named for him stands a short distance along the trail. A black and white photo of a man mounted on a horse standing on a wooden bridge. His saddle rests on a thick blanket. The saddle's foot strap has a leather flap that wraps around the ankle of his boot. He is dressed in a dark long-sleeved shirt and light-colored pants, and wears a brimmed felt hat. He wears long leather gloves that come up to his forearm. His pants are tucked into buttoned knee boots. In this rare 1903 photo, a Buffalo soldier poses on the Marble Fork Bridge in Sequoia National Park. A black and white photo portrait of Charles Young. He is clean shaven. He wears a white shirt under a buttoned jacket. On his collar are the letters \"U.S.\" and a U.S. Calvary pin of two crossed swords with a number \"9\" in the center. A quote by Charles Young next to his portrait reads, \"The people of the adjoining country and tourists are awakening to the benefits and beauties of the park and desire to protect the game and Forest....\" Text to the right reads, Who were the Buffalo soldiers? Buffalo soldiers were African Americans who served in the United States cavalry after the Civil War, primarily in the American West.

The View: The forest is canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The text reads, Community Look at the canopy above you. This forest is a diverse neighborhood that supports more than sequoias. How many different kinds of trees can you count? Look for differences in cones, leaves, and silhouettes. Protecting sequoias means safeguarding this entire forest. Across the exhibit are four indented rectangles, each showing a different tree. Each rectangle has a raised cone outline on the left. Next to it is a raised outline of the shape of the leaves (also called needles). Both of these are in true scale. There is a silhouette of the mature tree on the right of each rectangle, but it is not tactile or to scale. Going from left to right the trees are: 1. Incense-cedar, or Calocedrus decurrens. The raised cone does not have a typical cone shape; its two outer scales open into a v shape, leaving a thin central structure inside the v. The shape next to it illustrates the thick, short, flattened leaves on a cluster of tiny branches, forming a broom-like spray. The tree has a long thin trunk with a conical top. The text reads, Often mistaken for a sequoia, its leaves are flatter and its bark is harder and rougher. 2. Giant sequoia, or Sequoiadendron giganteum. You can feel a raised cone outline on the left. The cone is brown, with dark ridges crisscrossing it. The leaf to the right has what looks like long thin twigs, covered in small overlapping green scales, which are the needles. These needles are tiny and hard to see. The text reads, Its short sharp needles overlap each other, completely covering the twigs. The tree has a tall thick trunk, with short stubby branches starting two-thirds of the way up. 3. White fir, or Abies concolor. The cone stands upright on the branch, above the short needles that grow along the sides of the branches. Horizontal ridges tightly crisscross the cone. Inside the raised leaf outline, the photo shows needles in a row on either side of the twig. The tall narrow tree has branches pointing downward. The text reads, Needles grow in neat rows along the twigs. Cones grow upright and fall apart while still on the branch. 4. Sugar pine, or Pinus lambertiana. Inside the raised cone outline, the photo shows the cone opening. Dozens of fan-shaped segments, like scales on a fish, are open, having released the seeds within. The raised leaf outline on the upper right shows a cluster of five long thin needles, coming out of a central point. The text reads, Long slender branches extend far from the trunk. Needles grow in bunches of five.

Each hole is between 4 and 12 inches wide, in a conical shape. On the left side of the rock, is a Bay Laurel tree, with long, dark green, pointy leaves. The leaves are aromatic when crushed. Overhead are Canyon Live Oak trees, with oval leaves that are jagged and pointy on the outer edge. A large Sumac bush on the right has olive green leaves that are oval with a pointed tip. From this site, you can often hear the river flowing through the canyon below this exhibit. The text reads, This site once served as a busy kitchen for a village. It provided Native American people everything they needed for cooking: rocks and sticks to shape into bowls and utensils, river water, and nutritious acorns from oak trees. Women chipped the hollow bedrock mortars into these rocks to pound acorns into flour. Baked into cakes or boiled to make mush or soup, acorn meal sustained the village. The main image is a black and white photo of an older American Indian woman seated crossed legged in a printed dress, with an apron around her waist. Around her are three deep rounded baskets made of woven grasses or reeds. Two are striped and one has a zigzagged pattern. Two long narrow sticks rest atop the largest basket. To her right is a large cloth laid out on the ground. Two shallower plain baskets lie on the cloth. A building made of upright slatted wood boards is seen behind her. The caption reads, Western Mono tribe member Hi a inh, also called Jane Whaley, sits with traditional baskets and stirring tool (1929 to 1930). Another black and white photo shows a middle-aged American Indian woman at work. Her dark hair pulled back in a bun and she's wearing a dress with a ruffled collar, seated on a blanket on a large flat rock. With arms bent, she holds a conical shaped stone the size of a bread loaf above a round hole in the stone next to her. The caption reads, Women used a shaped stone to pound acorns into meal or flour.

This exhibit features a photograph of the brown trunk, a very large trunk of a mature giant sequoia tree. Other mature firs trees are seen in the background, and a cluster of small fir seedlings are in the photo’s foreground. The photo’s caption reads, “White fir seedlings grow thickly around the base of this mature sequoia.” The exhibit text reads, “Where sequoias grow, white firs can usually be found nearby. These two tree species compete for space and sunlight on the forest floor. Both trees begin as seeds that are dropped on the forest floor from cones high above. Once the seeds sprout, their roots must reach bare soil to get nourishment to survive. White firs have larger seeds that provide energy to grow longer roots. Tiny sequoia seeds sprout shorter roots that often die before reaching nutrients and water. Without the frequent fires that are natural to sequoia groves, white firs would take over. When fire moves through the forest, sequoias gain the advantage. Fire clears away dead leaves and exposes bare mineral soil. Heat triggers sequoia cones to release their seeds, resulting in masses of seedlings when conditions are right for them to survive. Thick bark protects older sequoias from fire. To the right of the giant sequoia photograph is a smaller photo of a small, brown-tinged sequoia seedling and a sequoia cone, found atop incense cedar twigs and plant material on the forest floor. The photo’s caption reads, “A Warming Forest“, “In this sequoia grove, winter’s storms build a deep snowpack that melts continuously through spring. If the forest becomes warmer, more precipitation will fall as rain, not snow. The snowy season would shorten, resulting in drier summers. Sequoias may struggle to reproduce in these conditions. If temperatures climb, the youngest trees may disappear, threatening the future of the grove.”", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Audio Description", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Hazelwood Nature Trail, Giant Forest", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

The section is about 15 feet in diameter. A thick crack runs through its center. Thick bark is seen on the top but has been worn away lower down. You can feel how uneven the outer edge of the trunk is. Thin cracks run roughly parallel to the outer edge. On the wood around the outer edges of these cracks, you may feel very subtle ridges, running perpendicular to the cracks. Each ridge represents one year of growth after the fire, as the tree wraps around the edge of the scar to cover the opening, and protect the tree. The text reads, Cross-Section Story This slab from the stump of a giant sequoia tells a story of fire and survival. The annual growth rings show that the tree lived about 2,210 years. Marks within some rings show that, during that time, at least 80 different fires burned hot enough to leave a scar. Mature sequoias survive all but the very hottest fires. Thick, fibrous bark insulates the tree from killing heat. The bark holds very little sap or pitch, so it is not very flammable. As you can see in the slab, even if fire does penetrate the bark on occasion, it doesn't often kill the tree. Mature sequoias live quite well despite large fire scars. A photo of the trunk section. The caption reads, This slab was sliced from the base of a giant sequoia that grew not far from here. In 1950 the park cut the tree down because it threatened to fall on rental cabins. Recognizing the hazard to both visitors and trees, the park eventually moved overnight facilities out of the sequoia grove. Visitors no longer risk having sequoias fall on them while they sleep. Two-thousand-year -old sequoias no longer risk being felled because they lean over little cabins. An inset circular photo shows a close up of the trunk section, entitled, Scars and Healing It shows two dark curved cracks. The cracks are highlighted in red and the wood outside the cracks is highlighted in yellow. The caption for the red highlights reads, These scars reveal how many fires were hot enough to damage the word beneath the bark. A typical sequoia here has survived several such fires during each century of its life. The caption for the yellow highlights reads, Notice wider growth rings next to the cracks. After fire, sequoias often grow faster for a few years. It may be due to decreased competition for nutrients and water for several years after surrounding plants are burned away. A black and white photo of this sequoia tree starting to lean to one side as loggers cut the base.

It also has safety information. A black and white historic photo of a cave filled with rough and polished marble, including icicle like stalactites and mounds of stalagmites. A large tour group of all ages is intently focused on what the ranger is pointing to. Many women are wearing skirts that fall below their knees. A few men wear short brimmed hats. The caption reads, A 1950s tour group views Marble Hall, the largest room in Crystal Cave. The text below reads, Welcome the Crystal Cave Wild Cave Tour Learn proper caving techniques as you explore off trail and crawl and climb through passageways on this four to six-hour tour. Limited to 6 people, ages 16 and up. Before your Tour Remove all food and scented items from your vehicle and place them in food storage lockers in the parking area. Store all food, coolers, related items, and anything with an odor (even if it's not food) including unopened cans and bottles. Deposit garbage immediately in bear proof containers or store it like food. Take infant seats out of cars; the smells they absorb may attract bears. If You See a Bear Don't let a bear approach you or your food. Wave your arms. Make loud noises, and throw small rocks in its direction (avoid hitting the face or head). Keep a safe distance but be persistent. If a bear does get food, never try to take it back. On the right side of the board is a photo of a rectangular solar panel, with a shiny black surface with a grid of thin metal lines. It sits on a rod, tilting upward. The text reads, Going Solar With the help of a grant, the Crystal Cave lightening system received an important upgrade. Solar panels replaced the old propane generator, eliminating noise and operating costs. New efficient lights reduce energy use. More importantly, the new system will protect the cave and its watershed. A photo of a man installing lighting cables in the cave. The caption reads, LED bulbs are bright and efficient. They also do less harm to sensitive cave dwelling animals that are sensitive to light and heat. A photo shows a close-up of a flat tan surface, separated from a foamy looking green surface, by a curved line of tiny white crystals. The caption reads, Less algae and moss grow under LED lights than under the old lighting system.

It is paved and lit. The trail winds through large and small cave passages. There is a photo of the historic Spider Web Gate, a metal gate made to look like a web across the cave's opening. Others include a brimstone dam in a cave room and water polished marble bedrock. A map of this area shows our location in the parking area. Safety information, Getting to Crystal Cave It is a half mile walk from here to the cave where the tour starts. The downhill trip to the cave entrance takes approximately 20 minutes. The trail is paved but has stairs, uneven ground, steep drop offs, and can be slippery. It can be icy in early summer or late fall, or slippery at any time. After the tour, the uphill return trip is steep and strenuous, with a 320-foot (or 100 m) elevation gain; take your time and enjoy the scenery. Consider the strenuous nature of the trail before participating in a cave tour, especially if you have heart, respiratory, or mobility concerns. The total walking distance, including the tour, is 1.5 miles (or 2.4 km) There are no restrooms on the trail to the cave or at the cave. From the time you leave this parking area, no restrooms will be available for at least 1 and a half hours. Use restrooms here before heading down the trail. Drinking water is not available at the cave. Bottled water can be purchased at the information booth. On future visits, consider bringing drinking water in a reusable bottle. Protect Crystal Cave Do not touch cave formations. These \"growing rocks\" are easily damaged by touching. Oils and dirt from human hands discolor them and prevent them from growing. Leave bulky items in your car or at the cave entrance. Backpacks, tripods, hiking sticks, and other items that can damage cave formations cannot be carried into the cave. Child carriers of any kind are not allowed; babies are safest when carried in front. Pets are not allowed on the trail or in the cave. Pets may not be left unattended in the parking area or in your vehicle. Food and drink cannot be consumed in the cave (except water). Leave all natural and historic objects undisturbed. Please do not take rocks, cones, cultural artifacts, or other items. Protect Yourself All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Rattlesnakes and bees may be seen along the trail to the cave. If you see them, keep your distance and inform cave staff. Poison oak, which can cause a rash, grows here. Avoid touching plants along the trail and near the cave. Stay on trails. Watch out for uneven or slippery footing. The trail is paved, but can be uneven, wet, or even icy. It is not brightly lit. Watch for stairs, narrow passageways, and low ceilings. The cave trail is steep and strenuous for some visitors. If you have physical limitations that will make it difficult for you to complete the cave tour and return trip, reconsider your plans to visit.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Animal-Safe Food Storage", "Audio Description", "Gifts/Souvenirs/Books", "Information", "Information - Ranger/Staff Member Present", "Parking - Auto", "Picnic Table", "Recycling", "Restroom", "Restroom - Seasonal", "Toilet - Flush", "Trailhead", "Trash/Litter Receptacles"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Generals Highway, Sequoia National Forest", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Geologic Formation", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

About three feet to the left of the exhibit is a picture post, a metal post about four feet tall. The View: In front of the sign are two mature blue oak trees, and to your right is a California buckeye tree. Landscaped native flowers and plants surround the path. On the wayside is a large background image of a green, grassy hillside dotted with trees. A caption identifies the trees as \"Blue oak trees.\" The text is written in both English and Spanish. The English text reads, Tough blue oaks, like the tree before you, are key to most life in the foothills. Well-adapted to survive summer's heat, they produce abundant acorns. Many birds, mammals, and insects rely on acorns, especially in fall. In turn, others rely on the acorn-eating species. Climate is key to acorn production. If climate change brings hotter weather or less rain, the timing, quantity, or quality of acorns will shift. Help scientists track changes in these trees and in their ecosystem by taking photos using the nearby picture post. On the bottom left are two photos. The first is of an acorn woodpecker with an acorn in its beak on a tree trunk filled with acorns in holes. The next is of a black bear climbing a tree. The caption reads, Some animals depend entirely on fall's nutrient-rich blue oak acorns. To survive winter, black bears gorge on acorns and woodpeckers cache them in trees. On the top right is a large inset with four photos. The header reads, Rain falls mostly December through March, with very little summer or fall moisture. A photo of bright green, round leaves has three large illustrated raindrops overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, New Leaves. Bright green leaves usually burst from leaf buds in February through March. Blue oaks rely on winter rain to produce this growth. A photo of small, round, yellow-green blossoms among leaves has two large illustrated raindrops overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, Tiny Blossoms. Oak flowers aren't very flower-like. They're catkins, hanging clusters of blooms with no petals. Look for these small green flowers in spring. A photo of small green acorns on a leafy branch has an illustrated sun overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, Fruit of the Oak. From catkins come acorns, the blue oak's prized product. With too little rain, acorns may drop before maturing. A photo of small, brown acorns on a sparse branch has one illustrated raindrop overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, Fall Harvest. Some animals travel miles for the ripe, brown acorns. Look for this vital food on oak branches and the ground below and in animal scat (poop). Below the captions, footer text reads, Find its Phase. Look at the blue oak in front of you. What seasonal phase do you see? On the bottom right of the wayside is a QR code. Text reads, How else does climate change affect life in these parks? Scan the code or visit go.nps.gov/cycle2 About three feet to your left is the picture post. On top of the pole is an eight-sided platform. Each side has an illustrated outline of a camera pointed outward and arrows to indicate clockwise movement, as well as a number and direction label. Side 1 is N, side 2 is NE, side 3 is E, side 4 is SE, side 5 is S, side 6 is SW, side 7 is W, side 8 is NW. On top is an outline of the front of a camera with the labels 9 and Up. On the post is a sign with instructions, a QR code and the url go.nps.gov/post5, and a diagram of the top of the post. The text reads, Picture Post. Instructions: 1.

There were plans to log the giant sequoias. Local citizens saved them by demanding the creation of Sequoia National Park in 1890. Early 1900s. Round Meadow, ringed by cabins, was still privately owned. In 1916 donations to the National Geographic Society bought Round Meadows for public use. Late 1900s. As the park became more popular, roads, campground, utilities, and public cabins spread around the meadow. In the 1970's the public began to support efforts to repair years of ecological damage. The park began eliminating facilities, removing the last building in 1999. Today. It's up to us to carry on. If we want to save sequoias, we must preserve their habitat, the natural places and processes that allow these amazing trees to thrive.

The outer walls are made of logs that have been cut down the length on four sides, to create long square beams, about two feet thick. These are stacked on top of each other to form the walls, and connected to each other with notches at the corners of the building. The top of the front wall is covered with wide wooden planks, and the peaked roof is covered with wooden shingles. The cabin has a double door at the entrance, divided by a post in the middle. Inside, the cabin has a dirt floor. There is a window on each side wall, and a stone fireplace on the back wall. The fireplace stones are rough cut, with a thin layer of mortar in between them. The stone base juts out in front. The fireplace is about ten feet across, with a five-foot opening in the center for burning wood in the inner hearth. A metal beam supports the rocks above the opening. A large squared off log forms the mantelpiece above the fireplace. The cabin framing for the roof is visible. It is mostly built out of round peeled logs, with a few squared off. Daylight shines through cracks in between the logs and planks, including a few spots in the roof. A wayside exhibit mounted on the fence outside is titled \"Changing Values\" and shows black and white photos and text about the adjacent Gamlin Cabin. A photo of people posing in front of this cabin, except that the cabin has only one door. The men wear hats, pants and shirts with vests. The women wear long skirts and puffy blouses. Additional detail, from left to right: A man with a bushy beard and a pocket watch. A donkey with two barefoot children astride its back. The boy is about 5 years old, in overalls, and the girl is about 10, in a dress. Both wear large straw hats. A woman holding the donkey's reins wears a ruffled apron, and a hat with decorations. In the doorway are two women in calf-length skirts, one with a scarf around her neck, like a tie. A man wearing a hat and watch chain, pets a dog. Another man wearing knee high boots leans against the building with his foot on a wagon. A caption notes, The logs of the Gamlin Cabin are sugar pine, and the roof shakes are sequoia wood. The text reads, Built before these sequoias were protected as a park, this cabin has seen many changes. How people used it varied with why they came to the grove. A timeline of pictures and history along the bottom reads, from left to right,Uses of the Gamlin Cabin. An oval portrait photo of a man with a light-colored mustache and beard, wearing a rounded short brimmed hat and a suit with a vest and tie. The caption reads, 1872. Israel Gamlin and his brother Thomas built the cabin, then lived in it for two summers while grazing sheep. Before living here, they lived in the Fallen Monarch, a downed sequoia further along this trail. A photo of a man in a uniform and hat, mounted on a horse in front of a massive sequoia tree trunk. The caption reads, 1890. After the park was created, the U.S. Cavalry came to protect the trees. They stored hay and grain for their horses in the cabin. A photo of a man with his hands on his hips. He has dark hair and a thick moustache, and wears a hat, white shirt, a dark vest with a badge and watch chain, and dark trousers. The caption reads, 1902 through 1909.

The first campsite along the trail is 4 miles from the trailhead at Snowslide.<br /> <br /> As you hike, look for views of Homer's Nose, a prominent granite dome that can be seen from Visalia.</p> <h4>Road Conditions</h4> <p>The South Fork Road is currently impassable within the national park due to extensive, heavy damage from flooding and landslides during winter storms in 2022-2023. No trailhead parking is available. When the road was open, it was a very rugged, backcountry road. Many sections of the road are one-lane with limited visibility. There are also stretches with steep drop-offs and no shoulder. High clearance vehicles are recommended. </p>", "audioDescription": "This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the South Fork area. The text reads, two trails from this secluded area lead to low-elevation sequoia groves. One of these, Garfield Grove, formed the heart of the original 1890 Sequoia National Park. Only later was the park enlarged to include other groves and, later still, the high peaks. Like most park trails, these lead into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. A map shows the location of the South Fork Trail. A photo shows a creek cascading through a bank of large rocks, surrounded by trees. The caption reads, Ladybug Trail 4.2 miles (or 6.8 km) one way. This relatively easy trail begins at the end of the parking area and ends at Whiskey Log Camp in the South Fork sequoia grove. As you hike, look along the ridge to the north for views of Homer's Nose, a prominent granite dome. The first permitted camping spot on this trail is Ladybug Camp (1.7 miles, or 2.7 km). A photo shows a row of large reddish-brown sequoia trunks in a lush grove. The caption reads, Garfield Grove Trail, 2.9 miles (or 4.7 km) one way to first sequoias. This trail begins along the road, just before the parking area. It climbs across north facing slopes into Garfield Grove, one of the largest sequoia groves in this park. The first permitted camping is at Snowslide Creek (3.6 miles or 5.8 km). Beyond Garfield Grove, the trail levels out as it approaches Hockett Meadow, 11.1 miles (or 17.9 km) from here. A quote by Joseph Wood Krutch, \"The idea of wilderness is one of the permanent homes of the human spirit.\" A bottom photo shows tree covered mountains with a granite peak with traces of snow in the distance.

Out of the largest 30 trees, 18 can be found here.<br /> <br /> How is tree size determined? In this system, trees are measured by trunk volume only, not branches, leaves, or roots. <br /> <br /> Tree dimensions change year to year because trees grow, branches fall, and fires can burn and remove a portion of a tree. Until 2003, the Washington Tree in Giant Forest (Sequoia National Park) was the second-largest sequoia. After being reduced by fire, it no longer ranks among the top 30.<br /> <br /> If branches are also measured, the President Tree is the second largest tree, bumping General Grant to third.</p> <h3>Tree Facts</h3> <p>Height: 268.1 feet (88.7 meters)<br /> Ground circumference: 107.5 feet (32.8 meters)<br /> Trunk volume: 46,608 cubic feet (1320 cubic meters)</p>", "audioDescription": "In front of you is an enormous sequoia tree.

The branches are so short that the tree is shaped more like a pointed cylinder than a regular tree. The shape could also be compared to a fat carrot with a few broccoli florets sticking out near the top. Looking up from this angle, so close to the massive tree, almost all one can see is trunk, with a few branches very high in the air. The ground in front of the tree is fenced off.

If trail conditions are icy, you may wish to use snowshoes, which are available for rent at the Grant Grove Gift Shop (check for final decision on availability).</p>", "audioDescription": "Forest Description: You are at the beginning of a trail through a conifer forest that leads to the General Grant Tree. The forest is canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The branches of young sequoias give them the cone shape of most other conifer trees, like a Christmas tree. In mature sequoias, however, the trunk becomes much bigger than the branches. In fact, the top of the tree might only be about twice the width of the base, so it is shaped more like a pointed bottle brush than a regular tree. Branches only start about halfway up the trunk. The mature trees, called monarchs, are nature's skyscrapers. They can grow as tall as a 26-story building. Trying to glimpse their tippy tops could give you a sore neck. Their trunks are reddish brown, with thick layers of deeply furrowed bark that is soft and fibrous on the surface, like shredded wheat cereal. Some trunks have dark, indented triangular scars, caused by fire. These are widest at the bottom, and point upward. The forest floor is covered with a thick, soft carpet of pine needles. Around large sequoias, the ground is also covered with thin strips of bark that have shredded away from the tree trunks. The forest creates a rich habitat for a large variety of wildlife, including black bears, coyotes, mule deer, beavers, chickarees, and gray squirrels. Depending upon the season, you may also hear the sounds of forest birds: ravens, (insert birdsong?), nuthatches, (insert birdsong?), and Steller's jays. As the seasons change, so does the look of the forest. Spring brings warming temperatures and small colorful wildflowers on the forest floor. Winter brings a blanket of snow. Text along this trail is shown in English and Spanish but for this audio description we will only read English, and any additional information provided by Braille. This trailhead orientation panel features a tactile map of the trail, and an illustration of a giant sequoia, with a thick trunk, with reddish brown bark, and short stubby branches with clusters of small green leaves, that start high above the ground. The text reads, This grove showcases some of the best sequoia habitat anywhere, producing some of the world's largest trees. Allow 30 minutes to complete this Â½ mile (or 0.8 km) paved loop. Relatively easy, it has no steep slopes or stairs on the main trail. Halfway around the loop stands the General Grant Tree, one of the largest trees on Earth. Please, for the sake of the sequoias' shallow roots, stay on the trail. A tactile map of the Grant Grove area, generally described from the bottom to the top. A depressed surface with small round dots represents the paved road. Two paved oval areas have a raised letter \"P\" to indicate parking. A raised circle with a star above one of the parking lots shows where you are right now. Stretching out from either side is a deep groove that represents Grant Tree Trail loop. Little bars across the trail represent where tactile exhibits with Braille are located. There is also a stretch of trail, with raised square bumps, that cuts across the loop trail. It leads through a fallen hollow sequoia tree called the Fallen Monarch. It is a dirt trail with steps, which is not accessible. Please exercise caution! Near the top of the loop trail, on the right side, is a depressed circle with a raise dot in the center. This represents the General Grant Tree. A legend on top identifies six tactile shapes used on the map, already described. In the lower left corner, a depressed horizontal bar that represents 300 feet (or 91 m) in length. A few inches above it is a depressed arrow pointing upward to represent north. The text reads, Trail safety All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Watch for uneven or slippery surfaces. Be aware of what is around you and overhead. Branches, heavy cones, and entire trees may fall. Listen for cracking, snapping sounds and get out of the way. A free Braille copy of the entire exhibit text is available at Kings Canyon Visitor Center. On the lower right corner of the panel, an indented black arrow points right toward the Loop Trail. Additional Braille information reads, Welcome. This half mile, paved loop is about ten feet wide. Above is a tactile map. Above that is a legend that defines the symbols.

The most recent age estimate of the Sherman Tree is about 2200 years old.<br /> <br /> Sequoia roots are shallow but spread wide. They entangle with the roots of other sequoias, forming a kind of mesh that helps all the trees maintain balance and stability.<br /> <br /> As you walk among sequoias, watch for Douglas squirrels, also called chickarees. They climb into sequoias and chew through the stems of cones. If you come across a tree that seems to drop a cone every few seconds, you know that a Douglas squirrel is cutting cones for dinner. They then eat the green, fleshy covering of the cones; look for chewed-up cones on the ground. They also store cones and dried mushrooms high in pines or sequoias.<br /> <br /> The Congress Trail starts near the Sherman Tree, and provides a tour of some of the most spectacular sequoias of Giant Forest. This easy three-mile loop also connects to other trails that can take you throughout Giant Forest (be sure to take a map).<br /> <br /> The Sherman Tree was once named the Karl Marx Tree by the Kaweah Colony, a utopian group that lived in Three Rivers before Congress created this park. The Kaweah Colony supported itself in part through logging. When the national park was established, their efforts were deemed illegal. One of their original structures, Squatter's Cabin, still stands near Crescent Meadow and is on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> In 1903, the Buffalo Soldiers protected these parks. Their leader, then-Captain Charles Young, was one of the first superintendents of these parks and the first African-American superintendent of any national park. He developed plans to protect the legacy of the giant sequoia groves, oversaw the building of the first roads into the parks, and protected both parks from illegal logging, grazing, and poaching.</p> <h3>Services and Parking</h3> <p>The main parking area and trailhead for the General Sherman Tree is located just off Wolverton Road. The parking area is one of the main shuttle stops in the parks. Shuttles stop here every 15 to 20 minutes.<br /> <br /> Parking for people with disabilities is located on the Generals Highway 2 miles from the Giant Forest Museum and 3 miles from the Lodgepole Visitor Center.<br /> The parking area provides restrooms, trash cans, water, and food-storage lockers.<br /> <br /> Make sure that you store all food is stored in these lockers-bears can be active in this parking lot.<br /> <br /> The General Sherman Tree is about a half mile from the parking lot. Be prepared for an uphill climb when return from your hike. In summer, you can avoid the uphill hike by walking from the Sherman Tree down to the accessible parking lot and shuttle stop along the Generals Highway. From there, take the Orange Route back to the main General Sherman Tree parking area.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>Accessible parking is located on the Generals Highway 2 miles from the Giant Forest Museum and 3 miles from the Lodgepole Visitor Center. The parking area provides restrooms, trash cans, and water. An easy path leads to the General Sherman Tree from the trailhead. This wheelchair-accessible paved path is accessible by wheelchairs, strollers, and walkers. The trail is about 500 feet in length and is gently sloped.<br /> <br /> In summer, the free park shuttle leads to the General Sherman Tree accessible parking area.</p>", "audioDescription": "The enormous General Sherman tree stands before you, about 40 feet away.

The forest is canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The branches of young sequoias give them the cone shape of most other conifer trees, like a Christmas tree. In mature sequoias, however, the trunk becomes much bigger than the branches. In fact, the top of the tree might only be about twice the width of the base, so it is shaped more like a pointed bottle brush than a regular tree. Branches only start about halfway up the trunk. The mature trees, called monarchs, are nature's skyscrapers. They can grow as tall as a 26-story building. Trying to glimpse their tippy tops could give you a sore neck. Their trunks are reddish brown, with thick layers of deeply furrowed bark that is soft and fibrous on the surface, like shredded wheat cereal. Some trunks have dark, indented triangular scars, caused by fire. These are widest at the bottom, and point upward. The forest floor is covered with a thick, soft carpet of pine needles. Around large sequoias, the ground is also covered with thin strips of bark that have shredded away from the tree trunks. The forest creates a rich habitat for a large variety of wildlife, including black bears, coyotes, mule deer, beavers, chickarees, and gray squirrels. Depending upon the season, you may also hear the sounds of forest birds: ravens, (insert birdsong?), nuthatches, (insert birdsong?), and Steller's jays. As the seasons change, so does the look of the forest. Spring brings warming temperatures and small colorful wildflowers on the forest floor. Winter brings a blanket of snow. This trailhead orientation panel provides information notices, photos, popular hikes around the Sherman Tree area. The View: You are standing in a sequoia forest near the top of the trail. Trees are relatively small and far apart, with plenty of open clearings. As you start to walk the trail, listen for the call of chickadees which sound like \"cheeseburger\"; and the call of the chickaree rodent, which sounds like a high pitched, \"pew, pew\". Along the trail, you can touch tree trunks and smell changing scents in the air, leaves, and bark. By the end, you will be in a dense, tall forest of sequoias, where you can strut along a giant trunk or run your fingers over a tall twisted ball of roots. The text reads, The Sherman Tree trailhead There are three photos with information about three popular hikes. A photo of an immense monarch sequoia tree, The General Sherman Tree, with a giant sequoia forest around it. People appear tiny standing before it. The General Sherman Tree is a half-mile (or 0.8 km) down the path. A photo of three giant sequoia trunks grouped together, The Senate Group. It is part of The Congress Trail, a two-mile (or 3.2 km) loop that starts at the Sherman Tree and continues through the Giant Forest Sequoia Grove. A photo taken from the base of a giant sequoia, looking straight up. The deeply grooved reddish brown trunk gives way to a densely leaved top, with blue sky above. The text explains that the Trail of the Sequoias is a moderate six-mile (or 9.7 km) loop that splits from the Congress Trail at the Senate Group and rejoins it at the Chief Sequoyah Tree. It says to bring a trail map. Junctions along this trail can be confusing. A black and white photo portrait of man. His dark wavy hair is combed to the side and hangs down just below his ears. His eyes are light and deep-set, and he has a rounded nose. He has long mustache and full, bushy beard. He is wearing a wool overcoat with a buttoned shirt and scarf. The text reads, John Muir in Giant Forest In 1875 pioneer naturalist John Muir visited here and gave this grove its enduring name: \"...this part of the Sequoia belt seemed to me the finest, and I then named it \"The Giant Forest.\" ... a magnificent growth of giants grouped in pure temple groves, ranged in colonnades along the sides of meadows, or scattered among the other trees. ... when I entered the sublime wilderness the day was nearly done, the trees with rosy, glowing countenance seem to be hushed and thoughtful, as if waiting in conscious religious dependence on the sun, and one naturally walked softly awe-stricken among them. I wandered on, meeting nobler trees where all were noble.\"", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Benches/Seating", "Bus/Shuttle Stop", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Information", "Information Kiosk/Bulletin Board", "Parking - Auto", "Parking - Bus/RV", "Recycling", "Restroom", "Restroom - Accessible", "Toilet - Flush", "Trailhead", "Trash/Litter Receptacles", "Water - Drinking/Potable"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Giant Forest, Sequoia National Park", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Take a walk through the sequoia's world. If you plan to explore, be sure to purchase a map in the museum or any other visitor center. A map shows our location in the Giant Forest Museum area. A key names the main trails and shows round trip distances. Big Trees Trail. 1.25 miles (or 2 km). 1.5 hrs. To Beetle Rock. 0.5 miles (or 800 m). 15 min Hazelwood Trail. 1.5 miles (or 2.4 km). 1.0 hrs. Accessibility. Beetle Rock Trail This paved trail has a moderate grade. Only vehicles with accessibility permits may use the small parking area near the beginning of the trail. Big Trees Trail The Big Trees Trail is paved. From the museum down to the Generals Highway, it has a moderate grade. Around Round Meadow the trail is flat. Only vehicles with accessibility permits may use the small parking area at Round Meadow. Hazelwood Trail The Hazelwood Trail is unpaved with uneven surfaces. It is relatively flat, but has a short incline at the beginning of the trail. Other trails There is great variability among the trails in Giant Forest. Some other trails might be accessible depending on your ability. Some Things to Do Here A photo of an exhibit panel depicting a forest scene, including the shallow roots of a fallen sequoia tree.

From this point, you can also walk to the General Sherman Tree, Giant Forest Museum, or connect with other Giant Forest trails. If you choose a longer hike, a trail map is recommended. Maps are sold at Giant Forest Museum and other visitor centers.” The following trail accessibility statistics are also included on the sign: “Length of loop: 0.5 miles (0.8 km) from this point.

Do not feed or approach wildlife. All pets are prohibited on park trails. Most trails in Giant Forest are closed to stock. Leave all natural objects and artifacts in the park undisturbed. Please do not take any cones or other items. Do not disturb wildlife, plants, or historic objects.” “Protect Yourself All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Carry a map and know how to use it. Watch for uneven or slippery footing. Be cautious around steep drop-offs and wet or icy areas.

Nature, people, and spirit share this space. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <em>place to go through</em>. It is also known as Hospital Rock.</h4> <p>This spot along the Kaweah River supports a diverse mix of animals, plants, and trees. The richness of this landscape made it an ideal location for <b><i>Pah-din</i></b>, a village that was home to hundreds of California Native Americans. Today, it is still an important place for the descendants of the village, and a site where people of many backgrounds come to rest, play, and explore the natural world.The Hospital Rock area features hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Snow, ice, and water carved the surrounding hillsides and valley floor. In this place, several large granite boulders provided temporary shelter or space for tribal gatherings. The area namesake rock, <i>Pah-din</i> or Hospital Rock, is a massive 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Like the landscape, the river is a life force. It is home to fish and insects, and sustains nearby plant life.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Civilian Conservation Corps</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the Hospital Rock landscape changed dramatically. Assigned to Hospital Rock, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed several landscaping and improvement projects. They also cut a new stone staircase leading to the pictograph, built the Big Pool Trail and tunnel, and built a historic vehicle water station. Many local Native Americans joined the Corps and contributed to its projects nationwide.</p> <h3>Connections between Land and People Exhibit</h3> <h4>Native American groups lived, interacted, and traded goods in this village for generations. They continue to gather here as land stewards to practice their culture, educate, restore native plants, and for spiritual and special events.</h4> <p>Native Americans have a deep connection with the land. When Hospital Rock was an active village, the people cared for the plants and woodland ecosystem in ways that promoted health and abundance. From this practice, they were able to harvest materials necessary to live and thrive. Even today, these tribal cultural practices remain a way of life.Life here included fishing and gathering foods, cultivating the land, trading, playing games, visiting, andconnecting to one’s spiritual beliefs. The land provided everything needed to survive. People of the village harvested plants to build shelters, weave baskets, and create snares.Fire has always been part of this landscape. People living here depended on it for warmth and cooking. They also used it to clear vegetation to improve visibility and productivity in forests and grasslands.In this area, Native Americans hunted game, such as deer, squirrels, birds, and fished for food. Theyalso gathered plants, acorns, seeds, berries, and roots.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Homeland</h4> <p>“This is an ancient site, a sensitive site.... People took care of each other here. There’s a welcome feeling here...the medicine is strong.”A connection with the land is critical to North Fork Mono Tribal Chairman Ron Goode. “Everything out here is our relations.” Traditional Ecological Knowledge has been passed down for generations by his people, and children today have strong relationships with the land. This traditional knowledge guides their restoration of damaged meadows and waterways in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This work benefits not only tribal lands, but also national forests and parks.</p> <h3>A Village Exhibit</h3> <h4>In this area, the Mono (Monache), the Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal connected with their neighboring tribes to form a vibrant community. These connections continue today.</h4> <p>Many groups lived, visited, gathered, and practiced traditions here. Historical accounts document more than 500 people occupying this village. Travelers stopped at the village to visit, rest, or trade. Runners and messengers used the extensive trails to deliver news about events such as fires. Tribal leaders are responsible for the safety and welfare of their people, including welcoming outsiders, negotiating with neighboring groups, and maintaining peace.By the 1860s, Native Americans left the Hospital Rock area. New settlers forced many out of the area, while others died from newly introduced diseases.Today, Mono (Monache), Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal live all over the world. Some live on rancherias,  reservations, or other Indian lands. Their descendants maintain a strong connection to <i>Pah-din</i> (Hospital Rock) and often participate in park management decisions.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-A True Leader</h4> <p>The descendants of Chief Chappo remember him as a strong leader who was compassionate, honest, and decisive—a peacemaker and a healer. Responsible for the welfare of his people, Chappo lived peacefully at Hospital Rock for generations. In the 1860’s, when new settlers arrived, they brought disease and conflict to the area. Chappo made the difficult decision to leave his homeland to save his people. Today, his descendants share stories about his gifts, and work to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h3>Activity, Past and Present Exhibit</h3> <h4>Signs that <em>Pah-din</em> (Hospital Rock) was once a vibrant village are all around us. Pictographs, bedrock mortars, historic fire pits, and obsidian artifacts all tell a story of a way of life.</h4> <p>Imagine a time when a community of hundreds of people lived here. Picture a village with dwellings (called nobi by the Mono people), children playing, women preparing food, and men getting ready for a hunt. This location inspired a way of life and created traditions and practices that continue today.Village women processed acorns into a flour that was a staple food. They made depressions in flat bedrock to create grinding holes, or mortars, and used cylindrical stones as pestles.Redbud shrubs provide strong, flexible shoots that were split or kept whole to weave into baskets. Elderberry shrubs were used for food, cultural uses, medicine, or ceremonial use.Items such as beads and obsidian (volcanic glass) may be found here. If you find an artifact, help us by leaving it where it is. Take a photo, note the location, and report your finding to park staff.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Weavers</h4> <p dir=\"rtl\" style=\"margin-right: 80px; text-align: left;\"><i></i><i>“The materials that make up a Native basket serve to ground it to an area. The weaver’s culture governed the techniques used to make it and the designs that adorn it. And the voices of tribal elders whisper through it.”               </i>- BRYN BARABAS POTTER</p> <p>Weaving serves a practical purpose but is also an art. Nature not only provides materials but also inspires patterns. An active basket-making community continues to teach skills to the next generation of weavers.</p> <h3>Community Traditions Exhibit</h3> <h4>What memorable traditions occur here, past and present? The Hospital Rock area has a rich history of people, events, and activities that shape it and create a sense of  community.</h4> <p>The granite rocks near the pictographs of Hospital Rock served many purposes such as a shelter, a place of healing, and a location for ceremonies. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <i>place to go through.</i>Every Native American society has healers, who practice traditional medicine to aid ailing community members. On occasions, healers cared for injured travelers here. The English name “Hospital Rock” was first used in 1873 after a pioneer recovered here from a trapping injury.Spirituality was prominent in the form of reverence for the natural world. The land and its animals were respected. Creation stories were passed down within families.­Like the beat of drums, sounds from clapper sticks are an important part of cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial traditions. Clapper sticks are made from elderberry stalks.Today, families picnic together, share memories, swim in the Kaweah River, and hike in this spot.</p> <h3>Shared Voices Exhibit</h3> <h4>What is your native language? From past to present, many languages have been spoken here, connecting people to this space and to one another.</h4> <p>In the past, California Native American groups lived, met, and gathered here. They spoke a number of languages and dialects to trade goods, share news, and cooperate with others. Today, these languages are still heard throughout the Sierra range and foothills. People can tell a lot about their neighbors based on the way they say “hello.” A person’s language communicates to others who they are, where they come from, and how they live.Historically, California Native Americans each had their own language. However, each group spoke many languages to connect with their neighbors and fellow travelers.Today, travelers from all over the world rest, picnic, and enjoy nature here, whether they call this place Hospital Rock or<i> Pah-din</i>. While you’re here, listen for people speaking a variety of languages.Nature also has a language. The rustling of oaks, chirping of birds, calls of squirrels, and the roaring river flowing over granite boulders form the essential sounds of this landscape.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Our Language Lives</h4> <p>Language is Marie Wilcox’s life. According to Marie, “words matter and learning the language is important to our culture.” Marie is one of the last living speakers of the Wukchumni language. With the help of her family, Marie created a Wukchumni dictionary. Containing thousands of words and examples of their uses, the dictionary documents the living language of her people. As part of a movement to preserve our nation’s Native American languages, Marie’s work documents the art and heritage of the Wukchumni voice.</p>", "audioDescription": "After you exit the Hospital Rock Picnic Area parking lot, these exhibits are positioned at an angle along a sidewalk.

An upright, naturally flat surface on the rock, like a wall, starts about 6 feet above the ground and rises up to 15 feet. It is about 20 feet wide. On the top are vibrant red paintings of figures and shapes, with paint streaks running down the rock that obscure other painted figures and shapes below them. <br /><br />Known as pictographs, these images include what appear to be:<br /><br />Human stick figures, including one with about twenty small lines radiating out from its head.<br />Several parallel lines, some wavy and some curving.<br />A couple of starburst images with 10 lines radiating out from a central point.<br />Bird shapes with curved wings and tails.<br />A snake.<br />A tree-shaped outline, with five branches on either side of the trunk. <br />And several other geometric shapes, often with parallel lines radiating out at an angle from a straight line, like multiple arrows.<br /><br />People can approach, but not touch, the pictographs. The uneven path that climbs slightly from the road up to the pictographs is made of paving stones, dirt, and a few stairs. Immediately in front of the pictographs is a set of about 10 rough-carved stone stairs, allowing people to get a closer look at the images. Caution is advised, as the stairs are narrow and uneven.<br /><br />A carved wood sign with embossed white letters reads,<br /><br />Hospital rock<br /><br />Safety information text is shown in English and Spanish, but for this audio description we will only read the English.<br /><br />It reads,<br /><br />Please Be Aware<br /><br />Welcome to Hospital Rock, a sacred site for local California Indian tribes whose ancestors lived and died here.

Sequoia trees grow in front of you but not behind you. Based on the huge size of so many sequoias here, the Giant Forest appears to provide the best habitat anywhere for sequoias to grow. John Muir, famous Scottish- American naturalist, described entering this grove in 1873: \"A magnificent growth of giants... one naturally walked softly and awe - stricken among them. I wandered on, meeting nobler trees where all are noble... this part of the Sequoia belt seemed to me the finest, and then I then named it,\" the Giant Forest.\"\" A photo of the top of a giant sequoia tree.

The text reads, Within the Giant Forest stands scores of huge sequoia trees. This map- which illustrates the Giant Forest's trail system-highlights several of the large sequoias, including the General Sherman Tree, the biggest tree on Earth. The Giant Forest covers three square miles. It is the second largest sequoia grove in both area and number of sequoia trees. You can visit the Giant Forest via 40 miles of trail. Many of these paths are relatively flat and easy to walk. The map includes location the following trees, top to bottom: Adams tree. Lincoln tree. Chief Sequoyah. The President. Pershing Tree.

It's situated on top of one of the many moraines along the canyon floor. These piles of glacial rubble are higher than the canyon floor, and views from the cabin are spectacular. Look closely to see horizontal scars along the canyon's granite walls; these were scratched by large rocks frozen fast in glacial ice as it slid slowly downslope thousands of years ago. <p> </p>", "audioDescription": "You are in an area of rocky boulders with low shrubs. Small pine and cedar trees are scattered sparsely across the landscape. A small, one room, wooden cabin is at the end of a short dirt trail. A steep granite mountain range is seen from the cabin. A horseshoe shaped river is nearby. A rectangular wooden sign carved with white embossed lettering reads, Knapp's Cabin A metal plaque attached to the sign reads, George O. Knapp, a wealthy California businessman, conducted several elaborate summer camping trips to this region of the Sierra. This cabin was built during the \"Roaring Twenties\" as a storage shed for those expeditions. It is the oldest building in Cedar Grove. Knapp's Cabin is about 10 feet by 20 feet. The outer walls and peaked roof are covered with overlapping layers of wooden shingles. On the north end of the building, the roof extends three feet to form an overhang: a porch with a dirt floor. The cabin has a wood door on each end. The doors are made of three vertical planks of wood, secured by three thinner planks mounted in a \"Z\" shape on the interior of the door. The doors are fastened in an open position and you may enter the cabin. Inside, the cabin frame is visible. It is built out of peeled log poles, with a few squared off in a roughhewn rectangular shape. The cabin has no windows and a dirt floor. There are several granite boulders near the cabin. One is just to the right of the south entrance, another midway along the east wall and several just beyond the porch area at the back of the cabin.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Audio Description", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Parking - Auto", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Highway 180, Kings Canyon National Park", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Historic Structure", "name": "Significance"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

It is hollow. You can walk down uneven, dirt steps into the hollow center, and then continue down the hollowed-out trunk. The opening is about 5 feet high, so watch your head! The roots of the tree stretch up around the opening about 15 feet. As you reach the trunk portion, the hollow tunnel is about 6 feet across, and you can feel the trunk above your head and on either side. There are trip hazards along the way. Columns have been installed along the way to reinforce the trunk for safety. You can go about 50 feet through the trunk before it connects to the other side of the loop trail. On the wayside exhibit, a photo shows seventeen men posing by the fallen tree before you. There are wooden bedframes in the hollowed-out area. Deer heads with antlers are mounted to the trunk above the opening. In the background is a crudely made wooden table that seems to be set with plates and food. Two taller tables are covered with bottles and boxes. The men wear trousers and shirts, and most also wear a hat and either a vest or a jacket. Other details, from left to right include: a man with dark hair and a moustache holds the barrel of a rifle propped up on the ground at his left. A man holding a violin on his shoulder stroking it with its bow. A man next to him is holding a guitar. A group of men are in two rows. Seven, in front, are seated on various objects, a rough wooden bench, an upright wooden crate, a barrel, a tree stump and a fallen tree trunk. One man holds a cane. The back row shows six men standing. A man in uniform is mounted on horseback to the right. The caption reads, Like the Gamlin Cabin on this trail, the Fallen Monarch sheltered some of the park's early visitors. Construction crews such as this one camped here, sleeping in beds inside the hollow log. The cavalry kept their horses in it (note the mounted cavalryman in this photograph). The text reads, Even after they fall, sequoias endure. These trees resist decay, sometimes lasting for hundreds or even thousands of years on the forest floor.

A photo shows a historic black and white image of the felling of a sequoia tree. The tree is captured during its dramatic fall, at about a 45-degree angle. There are people standing safely near the base. The text reads, Living Proof Early explorers told of giant trees, but the public remained skeptical. At least three nearby sequoias died to prove that they lived. Cut into pieces, they were shipped across the country to exhibit as freaks. All that remains of the tree that once stood here is the Centennial Stump. Cut in 1875 for America's Centennial Exhibition, sixteen feet of the trunk were hollowed out and then reassembled in Philadelphia. People laughed it off as the \"California Hoax.\" There is a quote from an eyewitness to the felling of a sequoia in 1893. \"The immense tree quivered like one in agony, and with a crushing, raging, deafening sound it fell, ... breaking into a million pieces.\" Inset is an historic black and white photo of a fallen tree trunk. The cut base that faces us is about 15 feet high. Standing at the bottom are a woman, in a long white dress with puffy shoulders, and a man, in shirt and pants holding a hat. To their right is a ladder that reaches almost to the top of the cut. Near the top rung is a man, holding up a two-man saw that is taller than the giant section of the trunk. The caption reads, Mark Twain Tree Over 300 feet tall, the Mark Twain Tree was cut in 1891. Slabs of its trunk still hang in museums in New York and London.

An illustration of a distant view of this location, including the road, a ranch style house and mechanical equipment. On the roof of the house is the symbol of a yellow lightbulb inside a black jagged multipoint star shape. A spiral black line connects that to a smaller wood shed with two tilted shiny panels on the roof. An inset illustration shows a close up of what is inside that shed: three rows of generator batteries in a metal rack. Wires connect the batteries. The text reads, Silence and Clean Air Silence and clean air two of the priceless qualities we seek in national parks. Yet until recently, an obsolete diesel generator ran noisily 18 hours a day at this remote spot. In 1933, park employees installed a solar energy system here. Now for days on end electrical power is produced only by silent, clean sunshine. Sunlight strikes solar panels, energizing electrons. The resulting electrical current charges a bank of batteries. The batteries store enough power for three sunless days. For backup, a propane generator stands ready, but it is seldom used. Fossil fuels produce most of the electricity in Central California. Burning these fuels contributes to acid deposition, high ozone levels, and particles in the air. in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, ozone is damaging black oaks, yellow pines, and sequoia seedlings. Acid deposition is changing the chemistry of alpine lakes. A haze of airborne particles obscures once beautiful vistas. By switching to cleaner, more efficient energy sources we not only protect our parks, but give our hometowns more of the qualities we seek here. Ask for information on air quality at any park visitor center. A photo of a bunch of thin, yellow spikes. The caption reads, Yellow pine needles exhibit ozone damage.

In the springtime, streams and creeks swell to high levels as snowmelt makes its way down towards the Central Valley. Once the snow has melted, however, water levels drop significantly. By late summer, many water sources dry up completely. Inconsistent snowpack from year to year makes it difficult to predict what resources will be available for the parks' flora and fauna. By tracking water levels over time, park scientists can better understand this unique landscape.<br /> <br /> Are you interested in exploring watersheds in the Foothills? Join a park ranger at any point in the year to collect data as a community scientist. In order to be sensitive to the plants and animals that call these streams home, group sizes are limited to a maximum of 6 participants. Individuals with an interest in a longer-term volunteer commitment are encouraged to reach out.<br /> <br /> Call Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' Education Office at 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov for more information.</p>", "audioDescription": "This trail ends at a cascading waterfall.

Sparked by an escaped burn, McGee was a dramatic example of extreme fire behavior in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem.<br /><br />Natural fires were common and not very intense so they burned ground vegetation and debris, but left the trees. McGee left ashes and charred sticks where the trees once stood.<br /><br />Sierran plant species play an important role in fire ecology. Bushes have oily leaves and shaggy bark to fuel fires so they burn in any fire, large or small. Trees here are adapted to fire in a different way. Giant sequoia bark can be two feet thick and pine bark several inches thick, so fire rarely harms the living wood.<br /><br />A quote by E.V. Kormarek,<br /><br />\"The earth, born in fire, baptized by lightning, since before life's beginning has been and is, a fire planet.\"<br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />What Happened:<br /><br />After this area was logged in the late 1800s, few trees remained in this altered ecosystem where poor quality wood and branches were left to rot. Years of suppressing all fire here had disrupted the fire cycle. Dense brush grew under the trees forming fuel ladders.<br /><br />Fifty years later the dry September wind carried embers from a prescribed burn into a tinderbox of old brush and scraggly trees. Fuel ladders allowed the McGee Fire to climb from the ground through the brush and branches into the treetops.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />What's Next:<br /><br />The land seems barren after a fire like McGee, but looks are deceiving. Within two years the hills are covered with grass, brush and new seedlings. Increased food and light helps trees like sequoia and pine grow quickly. To speed up the process, foresters plant more seedlings.<br /><br />Today the Forest Service burns small areas under carefully controlled conditions to reduce risk of a large fire like McGee harming people and property in the forest. This also protects timber resources and wildlife in the area, while continuing the natural fire cycles.<br /><br />A badge-shaped U.S. Forest Service Department of Agriculture logo. <br /><br />", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "0", "amenities": ["Audio Description", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Parking - Auto", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "managedByOrg": "US Forest Service", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Highway 180, 3 miles north of Grant Grove Village", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

A quote by Edward Abbey: \"We need wilderness whether or not we ever set foot in it...\" Safety text says: Store food properly to keep bears wild. Do not store food or scented items in your vehicle. Store them in metal food-storage boxes or bring them with you. Travel Lightly: Trails here are for day-use only. Overnight trips are not permitted. Pets and wheeled vehicles are prohibited. Firearms are subject to state and local regulations. Discharge of a firearm is prohibited within Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks. Wood fires are prohibited on this trail. As you travel, choose to act in ways that preserve the wilderness experience. Blend in. Keep noise to a minimum. Leave Indian artifacts, historical objects, and natural items such as pine cones where you find them. Don't construct fire rings trenches, or other \"improvements.\" Don't introduce invasive species. Before hiking, clean seeds and mud from boots, laces, and equipment. Wilderness Safety: People traveling in wilderness areas should be very self-reliant. Immediate rescue is rarely possible. The responsibility to understand natural hazards and to travel safely lies with you. Plan your trip carefully. Carry a map. Be prepared. Creek crossings may be hazardous at any time. Bring drinking water or treat it. Never drink untreated water from lakes or streams. Know what to do in an emergency. Cell phones rarely work in most of the park. Carry and know how to use basic first aid gear. Be alert to falling objects. Take notice of snapping branches overhead, pay extra attention to windy or snowy conditions.

In the case of sequoias, a process that holds the key to survival is fire. Without it, these giant trees cannot regenerate. A photo of a tree covered mountain range. Sequoia trees in the foreground have differing shapes. A few with pointed cone shaped tops are identified as young \"spiretop\" sequoias. A sequoia tree with rounded full branches at the top is identified as a mature sequoia. A giant sequoia, with massive branches and abundant foliage, has a dead branch at its top. It is identified as a \"snagtop\". The caption reads, Shape reveals the life stage of a sequoia. Young sequoias grow into graceful spires as they race toward the sunlight. Mature sequoias show smooth clumps of foliage. The tops of the trunks eventually die, giving the oldest trees the nickname \"snagtops.\" A photo shows a green forest with a low fire burning around the bases of giant sequoia trees. A firefighter walks near the base of a sequoia. The firefighter wears a yellow shirt, a yellow plastic helmet, and a backpack. The caption reads, The earliest efforts to use fire to benefit sequoias started here. In the 1960s, scientists first learned how much sequoias need fire: Sequoia seeds rain down after fires. These seeds survive best in burned forest clearings. Small, frequent fires create optimum conditions for large sequoias, too. They clear the forest of competing trees and remove fuel that would feed unnaturally hot wildfires. Two black and white photos of other sequoias, photographed from the same position at different times. A photo from 1890 shows several sequoias. Park workers stand next to the enormous trunks. A photo from 1970 shows the same sequoia trees with thick clusters of young fir trees growing around the trunks. The text reads, Compare these photos.

Possible destinations include: Via Woods Creek Trail. A photo of a cascading waterfall, surging through rocks. The caption reads, Mist falls. 3.9 miles (or 6.3 km) one way. Elevation: 5,840 feet (or 1780 m). As the name suggests, mist from this powerful cascade surrounds the area of the falls. The trail and nearby rocks can be slippery here, especially in early summer when the river is at its peak flow. Be extremely careful. Via Bubbs Creek Trail, A photo of a pass through a rocky ridge, with a rounded crag to the left, and a pointed steep crag to its right. Low shrubs and a few conifer trees dot the landscape. The caption reads, Sphinx Creek. 4.1 miles (or 6.6 km) one way. Elevation: 6,240 feet (or 1902 m). Towering over the canyon floor, the Sphinx evokes images of Egypt's giant statues. John Muir named the formation in the later 1800s. A map shows the location of the Woods Creek and Bubbs Creek Trailhead. The bottom photo shows a hillside of large foxtail pines, with a snow-covered mountain range in the distance. The caption reads, Above Vidette Meadow, A quote by Shel Silverstein, \"There is a place where the sidewalk ends...\" Exhibit Two: This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the Rae Lakes Loop area. The text reads, One of the most popular loops in the Sierra Nevada begins here. The Rae Lakes loop travels 41.2 miles (or 66.3 km) through rugged canyons and alpine wilderness. Part of the loop parallels the Sierra Crest, sharing the tread of the Pacific Crest and John Muir trails. Because of the large number of hikers on the Rae Lakes Loop, special restrictions apply. Extra care with storing food from bears is required. Keep the camping restrictions in mind as you plan your trip. Above all, choose to act in ways that preserve the wild character of this remarkable place.

A photo of a sunlit meadow, dotted with large conifer trees. Vidette Meadow is 28.2 miles (or 45.5 km) clockwise. A photo of trees with bright yellow leaves, a conifer forest, and steep mountains with patches of snow beyond. Woods Creek Crossing is 15.7 miles (or 25.3 km) clockwise. A photo from a rocky ridge, looking down at three turquoise blue lakes. Glen Pass is 24.6 miles (or 39.6 km) clockwise. A photo of a lush green meadow, lined with conifers, with steep granite cliffs in the distance. Junction Meadow is 31.1 miles (or 50.1 km) clockwise. The text reads, Clockwise or counterclockwise? Choose the direction of your hike before getting a wilderness permit. Most people travel the Rae Lakes Loop in the clockwise direction. More time is spent climbing, but the ascents are more gradual, especially along the approach to Glen Pass. Hiking in a counterclockwise direction results in steeper climbs.

The height ruler is mostly made up of a long line of smooth, light grey cement paving stones that are each one foot square. So it is a ruler measuring feet, not inches!<br /><br />The exhibit begins with a darker square representing the base of the tree. This square is located in the middle of the plaza, close to the museum entrance. This paving stone is etched with an illustration of the entire tree, and titled, \"Ground Level on Sentinel Tree\". There are arrows pointing at either side of the base of the tree. The text reads, <br /><br />You are Here.<br />28 feet (or 8.5 meters) thick.<br /><br />A shorter width ruler, perpendicular to the height ruler, crosses the plaza to show the tree's width of 28 feet (or 8.5 m). A dark stone paver at each side of this width ruler explains that the Sentinel tree measures 86 feet (or 26.2 m) around the circumference of the base.<br /><br />After walking 20 feet (or 6 meters) further along the ruler on the plaza, another dark paver appears. It is again etched to show the full tree, but the arrows are now slightly higher up on the tree trunk.

Glimpses of the upper tree are seen through the branches of smaller giant sequoias that grow nearby. The text reads, “The Largest Tree on Earth.” In front of you stands the General Sherman Tree. It's claim to fame is the biggest tree in the world comes from the volume of its trunk. A few other trees trunks are bigger around. Some trees are taller. But no other tree has more wood in its trunk and the Sherman tree. The Sherman Tree's top is dead, so the tree's trunk no longer gets taller. However, its volume keeps increasing. Each year the trunk grows wider, adding enough wood to equal another good-sized tree. Check out the life-sized \"footprint\" of the Sherman Tree's trunk on the ground behind you. It gives an idea of the trees girth -109 feet (33 m) around at the ground- and its irregular shape. Natural growth patterns and fire scars caused the uneven shape.

From here you have an unusual view, because you can see the entire tree from bottom to top. Notice two characteristics of a monarch sequoia: The top is dead, so it's upward growth has stopped at 275 feet (84 m). It has a huge, cylindrical trunk, which makes it the world's largest tree by volume. As long as the sequoia tree lives its trunk thickens, gaining mass.

Their trunks are only 10 feet apart. You can touch and compare the texture of the two. The tree on the left has a healed fire scar and the bark is soft. The right tree's trunk has a huge triangular dark fire scar about 20 feet tall and about 10 feet wide at the base. The scar is recessed about 4 feet deep into the trunk. A softer, shaggy bark has wrapped around the lower edges of the scar.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />This pair of trees provides evidence that fire plays a natural role in the life of giant sequoias. In fact, most owe their lives to fire. The evidence lies not only in their obvious fire scars, but also because they may be twins. Centuries ago, they probably started life at the same time after a fire prepared the ground for them.<br /><br />Fire creates ideal conditions for sequoia seeds to germinate and for seedlings to grow. Heat rising from a fire dries overhanging cones, causing them to open. Cones then rain seeds onto fire-cleared, ash-fertilized ground - a perfect seedbed. Millions of sequoia seedlings sprout after a fire.<br /><br />Fire also kills many trees of other species that don't survive fire as well as sequoias. That helps sequoias by reducing competition for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Fire's heat may also kill soil fungus that could harm sequoia root. Groups of same aged sequoias like these tough twins are fairly common. Look for them as you explore the park's sequoia groves.<br /><br />A photo on the left shows the tree in view on the left, already described. The caption reads,<br /><br />Healed Fire Scar<br />Look for this scar near the base of one twin.

It is about 20 feet wide, and the top of the tunnel angles from about 10 to about 15 feet in height. <br /><br />You can feel the boulders around the entrance and on both sides of the tunnel. The base of the boulders has been reinforced with stones and cement, for safety.

It is near the bottom of the accessible trail, about 20 feet after the pavement changes from concrete to a wooden walkway. A tunnel about six feet tall by six feet wide is carved through the log. Inside, on the right, you can feel a deep hole in the center of the trunk. Deep curved cracks with smaller cracks appear along the tunnel \"walls,\" along with illegally carved names and initials. There are areas on the tunnel wall that are blackened. <br /><br />At the base of the fallen tree trunk, a root ball stretches up about 20 feet. <br />The text reads,<br /><br />What brought this huge tree to earth? Ironically, a tree's own size can contribute to its downfall. If the tree starts to become unbalanced, it's weight quickly becomes more than its shallow roots can support. <br />Sequoias may lose their balance for one or more reasons: road building, underground pipes, or soil fungi can damage roots that hold trees upright. If soil moisture increases, the ground may soften too much to hold the tree. Heavy snows or high winds can cause a tree to lean. Large fire scars at the base of the trunk may leave trees last to stand on.<br /><br />Sometimes sequoias fall for no apparent reason. First, some unknown factor can cause the tree to lean. Then, gravity and the great mass of the trunk eventually bring the tree down. When and why this sequoia fell are not known.<br /><br />A black and white photo of the fallen sequoia before you, the giant trunk lying on the ground. The caption reads,<br /><br />This fallen sequoia might lie here for decades, maybe centuries. Chemicals in the woods, called tannins, resist insects and rot. The same traits that enable the tree to survive for so long now enabled the log to linger after death.<br /><br />Photos of three famous fallen sequoias. The Auto log with a white mini van parked on the cutout area. The caption reads,<br /><br />Auto log fell in 1917. Closed to vehicles in 2002 due to rot. Sequoias do decompose eventually.<br /><br />The Tunnel log with a car driving through the tunnel. The caption reads,<br /><br />Tunnel log. Fell in 1937.<br /><br />Tharp's Log, a wooden plank cabin with a stone fireplace that's built onto the hollow end of a fallen sequoia. The caption reads,<br /><br />Tharp's log. Date of fall unknown. It had already fallen by 1858.<br /> <br />A photo of a woman looking up at a tree's roots that are five times her height. The caption reads,<br />Buttress tree. Fell in 1959<br />The text reads,<br /><br />Most sequoias fall uphill. Why?<br /><br />When branches and cones fall from trees, they tend to slide downhill until they hit a tree trunk. Also, fire tends to linger on the uphill side of trees due to air currents. Over the course of repeated fires, large scars may develop there. Later, when something causes the trees to fall, it often topples in the direction of the scar.<br /><br />As you explore, look for fire scars. Are they on the uphill side of the trees?

The text reads, “Giant sequoias have an exceptionally long life but will eventually fall. Wet soil of mountain meadows provides little support for tree roots. The logs of sequoias and other trees are a common sight around the edges of meadows. Sequoias are especially vulnerable because of their shallow root system. When a tree falls, it creates a new opening that spans the tree canopy to the forest floor. Sunlight fills this space, enriching surrounding trees with extra sunlight. A clear and sunny location offers space for understory plants to grow. Eventually, new trees will reach upward here, filling in the opening.” To the right of the main photo is a photo of a green thimbleberry plant with white blossoms. Next to it is a close-up illustration of thimbleberry leaves and a red fruit that resembles a raspberry. The photo caption reads, “Thimbleberries” , “When space opens up in a sequoia grove, thimbleberries are ready to grow. Their durable seeds last for years underground.

A photograph features a brown-phased pine marten standing atop a heavily trafficked path on the snow. The photograph’s caption reads, “Pine martens travel easily through snow and stay active through winter. They walk lightly on the surface without sinking, or use tunnels to move below the snowpack.” The main text reads, “In summer, if you walk carefully and quietly, you’ll find a huge variety of animals here. They range from large mammals like black bears and deer to the tiniest insects. When weather is warm, food is abundant and animals fatten up to prepare for cold weather. As you walk, listen for bird calls, buzzing insects, and other signs of this active community. Frigid temperatures and a deep snowpack quiet this forest in winter, but wildlife is still plentiful. Each species has a strategy to survive the cold months when food is scarce. Some are active beneath the snow’s surface, where temperatures are more stable. Others rest quietly through winter, using food reserves they gathered in warmer months. A few move to warmer locations and return when conditions are less demanding.” To the right of the main photo are two color illustrations. The first is a drawing of a yellow-colored pale swallowtail butterfly with its wings expanded and a green pale swallowtail chrysalis attached to a piece of wood. The illustration caption reads, “Pale swallowtail butterflies spend winter inside their chrysalis and then emerge as adults in spring. Like many insects, the adults die off in fall after reproducing. Their young live through winter as pupae, making the transformation from caterpillars to butterflies.” The second illustration is of a brown water boatmen in an underwater scene. The caption below it reads, “Other insects live through winter as adults. Some hibernate, and some simply slow down. Water boatmen live under the ice in streams and ponds. They slowly “row” through the frigid water, searching for air bubbles, and then rest on the bottom until they need more air.”", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Audio Description", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Hazelwood Nature Trail", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}
