It is the largest tree in the world by volume. There are taller trees, and wider trees, but the General Sherman Tree contains more wood (volume) in its trunk than any other tree on Earth. Another measure of tree volume is the total biomass of the tree-trunk, branches, roots, and foliage. Rapid growth over a long life accounts for the size of these trees, but they are not as old as once thought. The most recent age estimate of the Sherman Tree is about 2200 years old.<br /> <br /> The Sherman Tree was once named the Karl Marx Tree by the Kaweah Colony, a utopian group that lived in Three Rivers before Congress created this park. The Kaweah Colony supported itself in part through logging. When the national park was established, their efforts were deemed illegal. One of their original structures, Squatter's Cabin, still stands near Crescent Meadow and is on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> Surrounding General Sherman are more sequoias to explore, including a cross-section of a fallen sequoia with exposed tree rings and fire scars. Take some pictures and enjoy an up-close experience walking among the giants.<br /> <br /> As you walk among sequoias, watch for Douglas squirrels, also called chickarees. They climb into sequoias and chew through the stems of cones. If you come across a tree that seems to drop a cone every few seconds, you know that a Douglas squirrel is cutting cones for dinner. They then eat the green, fleshy covering of the cones; look for chewed-up cones on the ground. They also store cones and dried mushrooms high in pines or sequoias.</p> <h4>Safety</h4> <ul> <li>Be prepared for a 200 foot uphill climb when returning from your hike to the main Sherman parking lot.

Since this is a dirt road that is open to vehicle traffic, your dog is welcome to come along!<br /> <br /> The road will take you through a mixed conifer forest, and will give you views of towering granite cliffs and the south fork of the Kings River.
