These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite’s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent’s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground.

Men such as Scots emigrant George Anderson proved many of these visitors needs, serving as blacksmiths, cooks, and trail guides. Anderson himself built many of the trails still used in the Valley area.

Campsites are situated on one side of the parking area, while six food storage lockers line the other side. A restroom with running water and flush toilets are near the food storage lockers. A green recycle dumpster and brown trash dumpster are to the right of the restrooms, next to the path that leads to the trailhead. At the trailhead, a wooden sign reads, Tuolumne Meadows H.S.C. 1.8 miles, Elizabeth Lakes 2.3 miles, and Sunrise H.S.C. 9.6 miles. Two small signs prohibiting dogs and bicycles are posted. <br /><br />A two-sided sign, each side containing three panels, stands near the food storage lockers. <br />The first panel on the front side of the sign, which is facing the parking lot, is blue and white and reads, Food Storage Regulations, and has an illustration of a person bending down, putting food into a food storage locker, at the bottom of the panel. Text reads, bears attracted to human food and garbage may become dangerous and, tragically, may have to be killed. <br /><br />To protect Yosemite's bears, store all food in the locker provided. Because of a bear's powerful sense of smell, \"food\" can be any item with a scent, regardless of packaging. Bears are attracted to items we don't typically think of as food, such as canned goods, bottles, drinks, soap, cosmetics, toiletries, trash, ice chests (even when empty), and unwashed items used for preparing or eating meals. <br /><br />Treat your trash like food and keep it in your food locker or dispose of it promptly in a dumpster. Bears are clever and agile. Keep your locker closed and latched at all times. <br /><br />Only have food items out while you are actually using them. Otherwise, keep them locked up. Improper food storage may result in impoundment of your food or car, a fine of up to $5,000, and/or revocation of your camping permit. <br /><br />The second panel is pink and black, is titled, Warning: Black Bears, and has an illustration of a black bear running away from two adults, one man hitting a pot with a ladle, and a woman yelling and clapping her hands. A young boy peaks out from behind the man. <br /><br />Panel text reads, bears that lose their natural fear of people may become aggressive. When that happens, they may have to be killed.<br /><br />If you see a bear anywhere in the campground, act immediately to scare it away. Make as much noise as possible by yelling and banging pots together. If there is more than one person, stand together to present a more intimidating figure, but do not surround the bear. Report all sightings to a park ranger. <br /><br />The third panel is brown and white, is titled, Do Not Feed Animals, and has an illustration of a chipmunk eating an acorn, at the bottom of the panel. <br /><br />Caption: There is plenty of natural food in the park for all wildlife. <br /><br />Panel text reads, national parks provide opportunities to see wild animals in their domain. Keep wildlife wild! Feeding a wild animal is like giving it a death sentence. The animal becomes a beggar and unhealthy, making it vulnerable to diseases, predators, dangerous behavior, and cars. <br /><br />Though appealing and seemingly tame, wild animals may bite or scratch and can spread diseases and inflict serious - or fatal - injuries. Maintain a safe distance and do not feed the animals! <br /><br />The first panel on the back side of the sign, is blue and white and is titled, Campground Regulations. Text reads, about 700,000 people camp in Yosemite every year. Your compliance with these rules will help maintain this natural site for future generations.<br /><br />Campers - Reservations required; 14-day total May 1 to September 15; maximum 6, including children, per campsite. <br />Vehicles - 2 per campsite<br />Checkout - 12 noon<br />Quiet Hours - 10pm to 6am<br />Fires - Use only provided grills; gather only dead and down wood that must fit in fire ring; put out fires cold before leaving or going to sleep; read specific fire alert information.<br />Bears - Proper food storage required<br />Pets - Keep pets on leash at all times<br />Dishwashing - Scrape food into trash. Do not drain dishwater or sewage onto the ground. Dump gray water only into toilets in restrooms. RVs should use dump stations. <br />Trash - Use recycle bins; deposit trash in dumpsters<br />Other Rules - Do not dig or level sites, or move boulders; do not move tables from site to site; no nails, axes, or knives in trees<br />Emergency - Police, fires, medical, dial 911<br />Ranger - Call 209/372-4025, after 5pm call 209/379-1992<br /><br />The second panel is green and white, is titled, Campfires, and has an illustration of a campfire on the left side of the panel. Text reads, today's campfire smoke can impair tomorrow's scenic views and air quality. Please obey restrictions. <br /><br />Campfires are permitted only in established fire rings. Never leave a campfire unattended; douse fire with water prior to going to bed or leaving campsite. Down or dead firewood may be gathered outside Yosemite Valley. Use of power saws prohibited. <br /><br />The third panel is also green and white, is titled, Pets, and has an illustration of a woman walking a dog on a leash near a forest, in the lower left corner. Panel text reads, restrictions on pets are enforced parkwide to protect the park's natural features and to avoid conflicts with wild animals. Pets must be on leash no longer than 6 feet and attended at all times; do not leave pets or pet food outside at night. Pets are not allowed on trails.

In 1925, Yosemite Natural History Association built this Geology Hut as an observatory to educate visitors about Yosemite's geologic past. Text on the left side of the panel reads: Imagine one scene from Yosemite's past: Ice surrounds you. A chill wind blows above rivers of ice that originate at the Sierra Nevada crest and flow down valleys. For most of the past few million years, ice dominated Yosemite's landscape. Repeated glaciations removed the soil, eroded the bedrock underneath, and carried away tons of rock debris. Now consider the spectacular view you experience today. The scene-shaping continues. Since glaciers have receded, rockfalls transform the shape of granite cliffs while rivers and waterfalls slowly wear away valley walls and floors. The results of these landscape changes are visible all around you in the magnificent view from Glacier Point. Five illustrations are lined up to the right. Illustration 1: A narrow v-shaped canyon runs from near the top of the illustration to bottom. Half Dome looks somewhat different but is still the only noticeable feature. Illustration 1 caption: Yosemite granites cooled miles beneath the earth's surface as early as 100 million years ago. As tectonic forces uplifted the Sierra Nevada, powerful rivers and creeks cut Yosemite's canyons and valleys, carving the landscape into V-shaped canyons. (10 to 3 millions years ago). Illustration 2: Ice nearly fills a valley to the tops of its rock walls. The tip of Half Dome and a few other peaks are peaking out of the ice. Illustration 2 caption: As the climate cooled, a series of glaciers entered river-covered valleys-plucking, polishing, and transporting rocks. The largest glaciers filled Yosemite Valley almost to the top of Half Dome. (3 million to 20,000 years ago). Illustration 3: A valley is half-way filled with ice. The valley walls are exposed and appear more widened than before. Illustration 3 caption: Repeated glaciations eroded valleys, steepened granite walls, and sculpted many of the dramatic landforms we see today. (3 million to 20,000 years ago). Illustration 4: A lot of water flows through a wide valley with steep cliff walls. Illustration 4 caption: As the last major glacier melted and receded, Yosemite Valley filled with water and sediment, turning the Valley floor into a shallow lake. The lake eventually filled with sediment, creating a flat valley floor. (20,000 to 10,000 years). Illustration 5: A narrow river snakes through a wide valley with steep cliff walls. Illustration 5 caption: The extensive work of glaciers is visible throughout the park. Waterfalls leap from hanging valleys. Rockfalls from the glacially steepened cliffs widen the Valley. (10,000 years ago to present). A wall-mounted glass case holds a topographic map labeled: Geologic Map of Yosemite Valley, Yosemite National Park, California. A black and white xeroxed copy of a topographic map labeled: Map of Ancient Glaciers of the Yosemite Region, is placed at the bottom of the case. Three postcards thumbtacked to the enclosed cork board show an illustration of the firefall, Half Dome with a lightning strike, and Half Dome cables.

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion. On the sheer face of Half Dome, exfoliation causes rockfalls that occur every few years.<br /> <br /> Please follow the path to your left toward the Merced River to find the next stop.

This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event. Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams with fresh granite. You'll notice that most of the boulders along the trail here are covered with lichen and moss. This tells us that these boulders have been sitting here undisturbed for a very long time. In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872. As you make your way to the final stop on this tour, look around at the vast field of boulders and imagine the chaos that took place here just a few thousand years ago.</p>", "audioDescription": "A dirt path leads into an area surrounded by trees.

Together these waterfalls plunge a total of 2,425 feet, or about 740 meters, making Yosemite Falls one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls. What caused the creek to shift position? We can't see it from here, but behind Yosemite Falls there is a moraine left behind by one of those ancient glaciers. The moraine diverted the Yosemite Creek from its path down the steep gully and forced it directly off the cliff. This unique geological accident created one of the tallest waterfalls in the world and one of the most iconic features in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop make some observations about the ground surface that surrounds the trail.</p>", "audioDescription": "Along a paved path on the outskirts of a large, open meadow, views of Yosemite Falls and the tall cliff walls on the east end of Yosemite Valley open up.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "1", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

On the east side of the bridge, tall trees line the banks of the river and Half Dome rises over the tree line. A wayside exhibit is titled, The Story of Half Dome, and has an orange-toned, faint, background photo of textured granite rock. Text reads, millions of years ago the granite block of Half Dome was larger, but there never was a matching half. Undercut by glaciers near the base, slabs of rock fell away from a broad vertical crack in the granite, leaving a sheer face. Remnants of the missing rock still project from Half Dome's rim. <br /><br />There are more granite domes here than in any other place in the world.

This boulder is one of the largest you will see in Yosemite Valley but boulders like this are actually fairly common. All of them represent past rockfalls.

Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>", "audioDescription": "A dirt trail leads into a dense forest just behind the Yosemite Chapel.

In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar. The combination of heavy rain and melted snow across the entire watershed produces extreme flood events. It is under these conditions that the largest, most damaging floods in Yosemite's history have occurred. As global temperatures warm the snowline in Yosemite is likely to increase in elevation also increasing the likelihood of future floods.<br /> <br /> Our next stop is at a huge boulder behind the Chapel, across Southside Drive. To get there, please use one of the two crosswalks crossing Southside Drive and watch for cars.

Panel text reads, in the 20th century, five dramatic winter floods inundated this area. This marker indicates how high the Merced River floodwaters rose during those years. A table shows three columns with headers that read, date, cubic feet/second at Happy Isles Gauging Station, and Height of water level above this bridge. Five rows of data are below each header.

Fire plays a very important role in the growth of a giant sequoia.<br /> <br /> Giant sequoias have a dependency on natural fires for reproduction, which was not understood until the early 1960s. Lightning-caused fires reduce the competition from other evergreens, burn away the leaf litter on the forest floor, and leave a thin layer of nutrient-rich ash over the mineral soil, creating perfect conditions for seedlings to sprout. Look at the forest floor around you. Can you see the soil? Or, do you see leaf litter covering the soil?<br /> <br /> Also, the heat from a fire dries some of the mature trees' green sequoia cones, causing a shower of fresh seeds to fall onto a perfectly-prepared seedbed. When winter comes, snow blankets the Mariposa Grove. As the snowpack melts the following spring, sunlight, moisture, fresh seeds, ash, and mineral soil combine to create a sequoia nursery.<br /> <br /> To reduce the leaf litter and promote giant sequoia reproduction, the National Park Service began igniting \"prescribed burns,\" that are deliberately set and closely monitored by rangers, during spring and fall. When the forest returns to a more natural state, these management fires will most likely be discontinued. Then nature can resume its cycle of lightning-caused fires every five to twenty years.

Fires have burned here once every five to twenty years on average. <br /><br />The Grizzly Giant, like other older sequoia trees and those damaged by lightning or fire, has a snag top due to loss of sapwood and a reduced ability to move water from roots to crown. <br /><br />Look about halfway up for a large branch bending skyward.

Speeding cars are a common cause of bear and other wildlife casualties, so please drive safely at all times. <br />Enjoy the area but leave no trace behind. Pack out what you pack in. Stay on the trails to avoid erosion and to protect the landscape and water quality.<br />Fishing is allowed from the bank of the reservoir, but please use artificial bait and obtain a valid fishing license before entering the park. <br />Overnight backpacking requires a Yosemite National Park wilderness permit, available at the entrances. Day hiking requires no permit. <br />Please exercise caution when hiking near the Tuolumne River or around waterfalls. These areas can be very slippery, and the force of the water can be dangerous, especially during high flows between late spring and early summer. <br /><br />Photo: Two people with large backpacks are on a trail, facing away from the camera, looking down a deep valley that has a river running through it. <br /><br />Caption: Leave no trace outdoor ethics<br />Plan ahead and prepare<br />Travel and camp on durable surfaces<br />Dispose of waster properly<br />Leave what you find<br />Minimize campfire impacts<br />Respect wildlife<br />Be considerate of other visitors. <br />Please learn, practice, and pass on Leave No Traces outdoor skills and ethics. Following these principles will help protect precious backcountry resources.

The very name \"Hetch Hetchy\" is derived from Indian words for grasses and seeds common to this area. Please respect these extraordinary lands, as portions are considered sacred by the tribes and are protected under federal law. <br /><br />Photo: Two wildflowers are shown. One wildflower is deep red and is sprouting from a crack in a rock. It is labeled stonecrop. The other flower is pink and yellow and has multiple blossoms on one stem. It is labeled Harlequin Lupine.<br /><br />Panel text reads, the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, while providing water to millions of people, also provides access to spectacular beauty and some of the most pristine wilderness in California. Some of the most colorful and exotic plant species in North America can be viewed in the Hetch Hetchy watershed. More than 1,000 species of wildflowers can be found in the park including Heuchera, California poppy, lupine, wallflower, shooting stars, waterfall buttercups, bright California fuschia, brodiaea, dwarf monkey flower, clarkia, and Sierra leisiga. <br /><br />In the center of the exhibit panel is a glass case that contains a poster that reads, each year, 200 people finish their hike like this...<br />A photo is shown of 8 people carrying a person in a stretcher, down stone steps. <br />Text continues to read, don't let it be you.<br />Stay on the trail! Traveling off trail is a leading cause of hiking accident in Yosemite.<br />Ask about trail conditions before you go.<br />Stay away from swift moving streams and rivers. <br />Carry 2-3 liters of water and stay hydrated.<br />Bring high energy foods.<br />Wear sturdy shoes that protect your ankles.<br />Rest often.<br />Bring a headlamp or flashlight in case you are delayed.<br />Hike smart, and have a safe day!<br /><br />Looking down the hill from the small picnic area, past the parking area, allows for a great view of the blue waters of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and the O'Shaughnessy Dam, which you can walk on.<br />", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Recycling", "Scenic View/Photo Spot", "Trash/Litter Receptacles", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Just east of the parking lot, beyond a stand of tall pines, is a granite dome, Lembert Dome. The dome is shaped like a slide, the left side being a steep incline, while the right side has a long gradual decline. At the north end of the parking lot are two dumpsters, a brown one for trash, and a green one for recycling, each having a carabiner to clip their chutes shut. Near the dumpsters is a thin metal post with two signs. The top sign reads, no camping or overnight parking. The second sign reads, no parking any time, and has a two sided arrow pointing left and right. Not far to the right of the dumpsters are the vault toilets, which are two grey structures located on a wooden deck, accessible by steps or a ramp. Next to the restroom is a dirt path that leads into the forest. A wooden sign reads Lembert Dome, Dog Lake Trailhead. Two icons are located within two separate square outlines, and each have a red diagonal line slashing down it's center. The first icon is of a dog and the second icon is of a bicycle. To the right of the trailhead is a large, green tone, exhibit panel, inside a log frame, with log posts.Panel text reads, welcome to Lembert Dome parking. The dome above you was sculpted by glaciers, which have filled Tuolumne Meadows many times over millions of years. If you stood here thousands of years ago during a glacial period, you would be buried under 2,000 feet of ice! This trailhead accesses hikes to Lembert Dome, Dog Lake, Soda Springs, Glen Aulin, and Young Lakes. The upper half of the panel is a trail map of the area. Beginning at where the red dot indicates, you are here, in the middle of the map, yellow lines, representing trails, sprawl out from this point. To the upper left, the trails lead toward Soda Springs and Glen Aulin. To the upper right, the trail splits off to the right to Lembert Dome, before continuing to Dog Lake and Young Lakes. An icon for Parking, picnic area, and restrooms are next to the red dot. Blue indicates the water of Dog Lake and the Tuolumne River, and white represents Tioga Road, which runs left to right, with thinner white lines indicating smaller backroads. For more information about Yosemite maps, please call 209/379-1035The left column of panel text reads, take a hike! The trail to Lembert Dome or Dog Lake begins on your left (west) and passes in front of the bathrooms. Pay attention to signs, posted at every trail junction. Remember, this is the Lembert Dome Parking Area. Lembert Dome is moderately strenuous. The trail climbs 850 feet (259 km) through the forest to the bare rock of the dome. There is no trail on the rock. Follow the easiest path for panoramic views of Tuolumne Meadows and the surrounding peaks. Dog Lake is moderately strenuous. Surrounded by forest, this quiet lake is home to many species including water birds, song birds, deer, and dragonflies. Despite its name, pets are not allowed at Dog Lake, nor on any other trails. The Loop is moderately strenuous. It is possible to combine the Lembert Dome and Dog Lake hikes into a five-mile loop. Study the map for details. Do not walk on the road from the Dog Lake parking area back to this parking area. Instead, use the trails indicated on the map. Soda Springs is easy. Follow the gravel Soda Springs Road on your left. When you reach the gate, continue straight for about a half mile to the Soda Springs and Parsons Lodge. This easy, mostly flat walk opens up to views of the Tuolumne River, Tuolumne Meadows, and the surrounding peaks. Carbonated water bubbles out of the ground at Soda Springs. The Parsons Memorial Lodge has been a reading room, shelter, and place for lively discussion since it was built in 1915. The right column of panel text reads, before you go. Stay on trail. Careless steps damage this fragile landscape. Plants have a short growing season before winter snow blankets the land. Be prepared. Carry plenty of water and high energy food. Bring a map; don't rely on cell phones and GPS. Pack a flashlight in case your hike takes longer than expected. Wear appropriate clothes and shoes. Tell someone where you're going and when you plan to return. Pack out what you pack in. To help this wilderness thrive, leave no trace of your presence. You must pack out your used toilet paper and trash. Never feed wild animals. Human food is unhealthy for wildlife and encourages aggressive behavior. Respect animals at a distance. If an animal changes its behavior due to your presence, you are too close. Pets, bicycles, and strollers are allowed only on roads accessible by vehicle, never on trails. Pets must be on a leash at all times, and owners must bag and dispose of pet waste. Weather can change quickly in the mountains. Be aware of building thunderstorms. Stay off of exposed granite domes, open meadows, and lakes when storms are approaching. Get there safely. Roads in the park are narrow and winding.

Here, the summers are short, cool, and moist. Only specialized species can survive. The red fir is one such hardy tree that can handle snowloads that exceed 30 feet. This tree grows in pure stands in the upper montane zone. <br /><br />Illustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road.

On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). <br /><br />Caption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, The plants and animals of the habitat around you are uniquely connected. Interdependence is the only way to suvive within this extreme environment. One important interrelationship involves fungus, flying squirrels, and owls. Root fungi absorb food from trees, while simultaneously improving the roots' water and nutrient absorption. Truffle-like mushrooms growing from this fungus provide a food source for flying squirrels. In turn, owls prey upon the flying squirrel. In this circle of dependency, one missing link might threaten the survival of all.<br /><br />Illustration: A tree above ground and its roots below ground are a part of the main focal point of this illustration.

Residential housing consisting of wooden cabins with canvas roofs, are located on the west side of the parking area. A large exhibit panel set inside a log frame, stands on log posts next to the Dog Lake trailhead. The panel text reads, welcome to Dog Lake Parking. This trailhead accesses the hike to Dog Lake, Lembert Dome, Young Lakes, and Lyell Canyon, among others. Hiking maps and guidebooks are available at the visitor center. For your safety, please follow trail signs and do not walk along the road. <br /><br />The upper half of the panel is a trail map of the area. Beginning at where the red dot indicates, you are here, yellow lines, representing trails, sprawl out from this point. An icon for parking and accommodations are near to the red dot. A blue line indicates the water of the Tuolumne River and Dog Lake, and a thick white line represents Tioga Road, which runs left to right, with thinner white lines branching off Tioga Road, indicating smaller backroads.

The hike to Dog Lake and/or Lembert Dome begins at the uphill (north) side of this parking lot. Pay attention to signs posted at every trail junction. Remember, this is the \"Dog Lake\" parking area. <br /><br />Dog Lake (moderately strenuous) - Surrounded by forest, this quiet lake is home to many species including water birds, song birds, deer, and dragonflies. Despite its name, pets are not allowed at Dog Lake, nor on any other trail. <br /><br />Lembert Dome (moderately strenuous) - After Gaining 600 feet (183 m) of elevation, look for the trail junction to the summit of Lembert Dome. The trail climbs through the forest to the bare rock of the dome. There is no trail on the rock. Follow the easiest path for panoramic views of Tuolumne Meadows and the surrounding peaks. <br /><br />The Loop (moderately strenuous) - It is possible to combine the Lembert Dome and Dog Lake hikes into a five-mile loop. Study the map for details. Do not walk on the road from the Lembert Dome parking area back to this parking area. Instead, use the trails indicated on the map. <br /><br />Lyell Canyon (easy) - To hike up Lyell Canyon on the John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails, begin at the downhill (south) side of this parking lot. Cross the road at the crosswalk and follow the trail upstream. You can enjoy a short stroll along the river until you are ready to turn around. One mile up the trail you will reach Twin Bridges, a scenic crossing of the Lyell fork. If you're feeling more adventurous, this trail could take you to Mt. Whitney, over 200 miles (322 km) away, or all the way to Mexico. <br /><br />The right column of panel text reads, before you go. Stay on trail. Careless steps damage this fragile landscape. Plants have a short growing season before winter snow blankets the land. <br /><br />Be prepared. Carry plenty of water and high energy food. Bring a map; don't rely on cell phones and GPS. Pack a flashlight in case your hike takes longer than expected. Wear appropriate clothes and shoes. Tell someone where you're going and when you plan to return. <br /><br />Pack out what you pack in. To help this wilderness thrive, leave no trace of your presence. You must pack out your used toilet paper and trash. <br /><br />Never feed wild animals. Human food is unhealthy for wildlife and encourages aggressive behavior. Respect animals at a distance. If an animal changes its behavior due to your presence, you are too close. <br /><br />Pets, bicycles, and strollers are allowed only on roads accessible by vehicle, never on trails. Pets must be on a leash at all times, and owners must bag and dispose of pet waste. <br /><br />Weather can change quickly in the mountains. Be aware of building thunderstorms. Stay off of exposed granite domes, open meadows, and lakes when storms are approaching. <br /><br />Get there safely. Roads in the park are narrow and winding. Protect park wildlife, other visitors, and yourself by obeying posted speed limits and using turnouts. <br /><br />Feeling the altitude? Give yourself a day or two to become accustomed to the altitude. Signs of altitude sickness can include nausea, dizziness, and headache. Descending to a lower elevation can help alleviate symptoms. <br /><br />Wilderness use regulations. Wilderness permits and and allowed bear-resistant food containers are required year-round for overnight trips. They are available at the Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows Wilderness Centers, Wawona Visitor Center, Big Oak Flat Information Station, and the Hetch Hetchy Entrance Station. No motorized vehicles are permitted. <br /><br />In the middle of the left and right text columns is a small map outline of the entire park. The main roads and areas are the only things labeled. On the far left side of the park is a road that runs north to south. At the top point is Hetch Hetchy, coming down to Big Oak Flat, then down to Wawona, which is near the bottom tip of the park. A little less than half way up the road is an intersection the leads into the Yosemite Valley via a loop road. Just above Yosemite Valley is a road that extend from the left to the right of the park, the Tioga Road, With Tioga Pass labeled at the far right. To the far right of the Tioga Road, near Tioga Pass, is a red dot that indicates, you are here. <br /><br />From north to south, the parking lot slopes downhill a bit. There is a neat line of recycle bins, trash bins, and food storage lockers in the south parking lot. A crosswalk leads across the street to the Lyell Canyon trailhead.

As you explore the grove, you'll be following in the footsteps of countless people who have revered and worked to protect these magnificent trees. This grove is also honored because it is one of our country's first protected public lands. The seeds of the national park movement were sown here when artists, writers, politicians, and early preservationists convinced the US Congress and President Abraham Lincoln to protect the giant sequoias from logging, tourism, and development in the mid-1800s. Every National Park Service ranger carries a reminder of the significance of these trees and the movement they inspired. Look closely at the NPS emblem, belt, and hatband pictured here with the sequoia cone and tree silhouette.

A green recycle bin, brown trash bin, and a small, brown, wood, structure, which holds a vault toilet, all line the parking lot. A wayside exhibit, framed in thick, log posts, stands at the trailhead, which appears to be a wide dirt road that is gated at the entrance. <br /><br />The green-toned exhibit panel is titled Merced Grove Trailhead and has an illustrated map, which takes up a majority of the left side of the panel. The map shows a red dot at the bottom of the map, which is labeled, you are here. A yellow squiggle line, representing the trail, makes its way through a faint canopy of trees to the grove. An aerial view of about 12 bold tree tops are shown at the end of the trail, as well as a small cabin. <br /><br />Caption: The path to the Merced Grove is the roadbed of the historic Coulterville Road. Started in 1870, John Taylor McLean invested his entire fortune to ensure the success of the project. Although his efforts failed financially, his contribution resulted in the historic accomplishment of completing the first road into Yosemite Valley. Regularly scheduled stage travel began June 18, 1874. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A classic car is stopped next to a large tree, on a narrow dirt road that passes through a forest of tall trees. <br /><br />Caption: This small grove of about twenty trees was named Crane Flat Grove by the Whitney Survey in 1870. The grove was later re-named Merced Grove, reportedly due to its proximity to the Merced River. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the panel reads, the smallest of Yosemite's three giant sequoia groves, the Merced Grove offers perhaps the best opportunity for a solitary experience among these colossal giants. <br /><br />While enjoying your walk to the grove, consider the rarity of this experience. At one time, sequoias covered an extensive range, but now grow only in isolated groves on the Sierra Nevada's western slope. Limited by specialized growing needs, these trees require both moisture-mostly from winter snowfalls-as well as periodic fire. Frequent burns expose bare mineral soil for seeds to take root. Fire also reduces the number of competing species and opens the forest canopy for sunlight to reach the sun-loving trees. Sequoias appear large and strong; however, their shallow roots are quite vulnerable to damage. Avoid walking in areas immediately surrounding the bases of the trees. Leave cones and other natural items that you find. <br /><br />Illustration: A wedge-like, cross-section illustration that is thick on one end and tapers to a thin edge on the other, shows the slope of the trail. A red dot at the top of the wedge reads, you are here. A yellow line, indicating the trail, squiqqles downhill to the grove of trees. At the bottom of the wedge, an arrow goes from one end to the other and is labeled, 1.5 miles. <br /><br />Trail Conditions: Carry enough drinking water for a fairly rigorous hike. Make sure to allow 3 to 4 hours for a 3-mile round-trip hike. There are no restrooms or running water in the grove. The return uphill is moderately strenuous (600ft. (183 m.) elevation gain). This trail is marked for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in winter. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A small log cabin sits in the midst of a forest. On the front side of the cabin, a door is in the center with one window on each side. A stone chimney rises out of the roof. <br /><br />Caption: The old cabin along this trail was built in 1934 as a summer retreat for park superintendents.

For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. <br /><br />The wayside exhibit panel is located on the right side of the path and is titled, Mirror Lake. The panel has a faint, black and white, background photo of a body of water lined with trees and tall, granite, rock faces. Text reads, in the 19th century, Mirror Lake became famous for its magnificent views of surrounding peaks reflected in the water's glassy surface. But the \"lake\" was misnamed - it is simply a broad shallow pool in Tenaya Creek. The reflecting pool varies with the season. By late summer, when Tenaya Creek is no longer fed by melting snows from above, the pool disappears. <br /><br />Under a heading that reads, A Well-Traveled Path, text reads, Mirror Lake was a much publicized attraction for late 19th century tourists. It is still one of Yosemite's most popular hiking destinations. The view of Half Dome's 4,800-foot sheer face, seen from its base, is an attraction any time of the year. <br /><br />Another section of the panel is about mountain lion habitat and reads, you are in a mountain lion habitat. Children should not run ahead or lag behind on the trail. Hiking alone and jogging are not recommended. In the unlikely event that you see a mountain lion, do the following:<br /><br />Stay calm. Do not run. Do not turn your back on the lion.<br />Adults should pick up small children.<br />Make yourself appear as large as possible; raise your arms over your head and open your jacket. <br />If it acts aggressively, wave your arms, shout, and throw rocks and sticks at the lion. <br />If attacked, fight back!<br /><br />Illustration: A mountain lion, standing on a downhill slope, faces to the left with its mouth slightly open and its ears perked. <br />", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "34c92a73-05dc-45d3-a6bb-7265de8389ed", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Recycling", "Toilet - Vault/Composting", "Trailhead", "Trash/Litter Receptacles"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Two small signs that read, 'no camping,' and 'no dogs,' line the curb, near the trailhead. A wooden fence separates the parking area from the wilderness area.Six signs line the dirt path at the Mono Pass Trailhead. The first sign is a wayside exhibit titled Yosemite Ghost Mines, and has a faded black and white photo of a log structure, too shabby and small to be a cabin, but very cabin-like. Text reads, as early as 1860, prospectors explored Mono Pass in search of rich rock. Here, among the glacially carved granite and craggy peaks of the Sierra crest, these hardy men discovered silver deposits and went to work in hopes of fortune.Buildings of the Past - five log cabins mark the location of the Golden Crown and Ella Bloss miners near Mono Pass. This windswept site was established in 1879 during the Tioga silver boom that also produced Bennettville and the Great Sierra Mine near Tioga Pass. Significant wealth was predicted, but around 1890, the mines were abandoned.A Past Preserved - The cabins are increasingly fragile reminders of mining on the Sierra crest. Please help preserve these valuable historic resources by not using them as campsites or fire shelters. It is illegal to damage, deface, or remove archaeological objects or features from federal land. The second sign is separated into five sections. Two small square panels on top, a large map in the middle, and two small square panels on bottom.

In the east corner of the parking lot are two large brown trash dumpsters, and one large green dumpster for recycling. The wayside exhibit panel is blue and is bolted to a frame made of thick wooden posts, and is titled, welcome to Tenaya Lake. Half of the panel background is a two-toned picture of a lake that is surrounded by domes and peaks. The other half of the panel is a map. The caption reads, caught between immense granite domes and the clear High Sierra sky, Tenaya Lake is the largest lake in Yosemite National Park. Here, at its eastern end, Tenaya Creek forms a series of braided streams before flowing into the lake. Text reads, if you have a few hours, stroll the flat, paved trail (less than a quarter-mile, round-trip). You'll be rewarded with glimpses of the glacially carved peaks and domes and a spectacular view of the lake emerging through the trees. If time permits, take a picnic to one of the tables on the beach and enjoy a lazy High Sierra afternoon exploring or relaxing in the smooth granitic sand. While hardy souls may be tempted to jump in, remember...Tenaya Lake is fed by snowmelt and stays quite cold!If you have half a day, don't miss the boardwalk, a picnic, or the beach, but (if conditions permit) cross the Tenaya Creek inlet at the southeast end of the beach and follow the trail west along the shore of the lake. This mostly-level stroll takes you toward the Sunrise Lakes Trailhead, joining back with the Tioga Road. Here, you can retrace your steps back or hop on the free shuttle at Stop #10, and ride one stop back to your car (stop #9). It is possible to walk all the way around the lake (2.8 mi/5.2 km), but requires walking along the shoulder of busy Tioga Road. A full-day hike to Tuolumne Meadows - Pick up a trail heading east from Tenaya Lake. This 9-mile one-way hike parallels the Tioga Road, leading to Tuolumne Meadows. At Tuolumne Meadows, pick up the free shuttle for the short ride back to Tenaya Lake. Shuttle Information - The free Tioga Road shuttle runs between Tuolumne Meadows and Olmsted Point. Shuttle schedule changes seasonally and as conditions permit. Check local postings for current schedule. During times of high water, unbridged river or creek crossings can be hazardous. Take extra time and use good judgement when crossing rivers and creeks. Check the weather! Be especially aware of the potential for thunderstorms. If you are hiking, take a map and compass. Tell someone where you are going and when you'll be back. Avoid exhaustion and dehydration. Carry plenty of water and high-energy snacks. The altitude at Tenaya Lake is just over 8,000 feet above sea level. Signs of altitude sickness can include nausea, dizziness, and headache. Descending to a lower elevation can help alleviate symptoms. Scrambling or climbing on rocks can be dangerous. Remember, coming down can be much harder than going up, and wet rocks are slippery. Be prepared to pack out what you pack in; garbage and recycling receptacles are located near the parking area. Map: The map shows Tenaya Lake, indicated by a large, blue, oval shape, slightly tilted, in the center of the map. A white line extends diagonally across the map, from the bottom left to the top right, passing by the north shore of Tenaya Lake. A trail, indicated by red dotted lines, passes by the south shore of the Tenaya Lake and partly follows a few creeks, indicated by a blue solid line, before splitting off into different trails to the left and right. To the left of the lake, icons indicate the start of hiking trails, restrooms, and parking. To the right of the lake, a red dot indicates you are here, and icons indicating trailheads, parking, restrooms, and picnic areas are shown. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. A flat dirt path leads into the forest with several wayside exhibits along the way to the Tenaya Lake shoreline. The first wayside exhibit is titled, disappearing wetlands. Text reads, wetlands like this one have likely been here for the last 10,000 years, providing homes and food for a great variety of plant and animal species. In Yosemite, wetland areas make up only about 3% of the landscape, but are estimated to harbor up to one-third of all the plant species in the Park. They also capture, store, and release melting snow, extending the availability of life-giving water during the dry summer months. Here in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and across the globe, wetlands are disappearing rapidly. Effects from trampling, development, and climate change threaten to alter the delicate wetland ecology forever. In Yosemite National Park, park managers work to prevent loss of wetlands by preserving and restoring wetland areas and building boardwalks to help minimize damage from visitors.

Black and white photo: A man with short hair and glasses, wearing a heavy coat and a tie, sits at a table with a pen in his right hand, drawing on a map. Photo caption: Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. Text to the right of the picture reads, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. (1870-1957) also worked in the field of landscape architecture. He collaborated with the National Park Service and was a member of the Yosemite Advisory Board, a group of experts who helped park managers solve problems. He maintained a lifelong commitment to conversation, contributing the guiding language in legislation establishing the National Park Service in 1916. A second exhibit panel titled, Forces of Change, shows a black and white, faded, background photo of a large peak labeled Cloud's Rest and a dome with a smaller dome attached to it, labeled Half Dome. In the forefront, a large boulder rests on a smooth granite surface. Text on the left side of the panel reads, panoramic view. Half Dome stands before you. With a pair of binoculars, you can often see a line of hikers, like ants, climbing up cables to the summit. To the left is the massive northwest face of Cloud's Rest. From its summit (9,926 feet elevation) the sheer granite face, one of the largest in the world, drops nearly 5,000 feet to lower Tenaya Creek. A brief walk to the east side of the parking area will lead to spectacular views of Tenaya Lake, and Mount Conness. Powerful geological forces shaped this landscape. Evidence emerges throughout this granite scene. Chambers of magma deep within the earth slowly crystallized 100-80 million years ago to form hard granite rock. Over time, erosion by rivers and extensive glaciers exposed and sculpted the rock. Black and white photo: Two large boulders sit on a smooth granite surface, that has cracks criss-crossing each other. A man walks on the granite surface, and is a small figure in comparison to the the two large boulders. Caption: These large boulders randomly placed on the bedrock are evidence of the most recent glaciation. The rocks either toppled down slopes onto the glacier or were plucked from the bedrock. They landed here as the ice melted away. Black and white photo: Portions of a smooth granite bedrock seems buffed and shiny as the sun shines on it.Caption: Glacial Polish - Over the last million years, major glaciers have come and gone in Yosemite. Only 20 thousand years ago the most recent glacier extended from the high peaks to the distant horizon. Like rough sandpaper smoothing wood, these glaciers polished the rock you see near here. A third wayside exhibit panel titled Experience Yosemite has a faded background picture of trees and mountains that surround a lake. The lake is labeled Tenaya Lake. Text on the left side of the panel reads, Look and listen - Within this vast granite setting are the sounds of Yosemite's year-round residents. Listen for the occasional alarm whistle of the yellow-bellied marmot, the raucous calls of the Stellar's Jay or Clark's Nutcracker, or maybe the distant rhythmic booming of the male blue grouse trying to attract a mate. Stay long enough and a golden eagle may circle above. Growing twisted and gnarled out of cracks in rocks, Sierra junipers have red, ribbon-like bark and overlapping scales for leaves. Their blue, berry-like cones have a pungent gin-like smell.

The first sign in the parking area is a brown sign, outlined in white, and has white text that reads, no camping or overnight parking.The second sign is a small, white, metal sign on a wooden post located on the meadow side of long, large, logs used as barriers to separate the dirt parking from the meadow. A photo on the upper right side of the sign shows several bright, tall, wildflowers in a lush green meadow with a snow covered peak rising above the pine treeline in the distance. The sign reads, meadow restoration in progress. Trails that pass through sensitive habitats, such as Tuolumne Meadows, can have an impact that reaches far beyond the trail. We are currently working to restore this area. Please stay on the main trail shown in blue on the map. Please stay on designated trail.Photo: Two people walk off-trail through a large meadow. In the distance, mountain peaks rise above a dense forest. Map: In a square frame, the Tioga Road is indicated by a blue and white tick line that leads from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner. Above that line, sandwiched between the road and a large white area that indicates the granite of Pothole dome is a meadow, a wetland area represented by an upward-turned, banana shape filled with blue marks. A yellow star and text that reads, \"you are here,\" along with an icon of a hiker inside a red square, which is a trailhead, are along the Tioga Road, one quarter of the way from the top. A blue solid line, which is the Pothole Dome Trail, makes its way around the left side of the banana-shaped wetland area then leads to the right, all the way to the right side of the frame. A red, solid line cuts through the meadow from Tioga Road to Pothole Dome and forks out into two paths, they are marked closed.A wayside exhibit titled Sub-Alpine Zone, is located on the parking side of long, large, logs used as barriers to separate the meadow from the dirt parking area. Text on the left side of the panel reads, the plants and animals in this zone sometimes have only two and a half months to complete a year's work. At this elevation, the snow can be on the ground well into June, only to return as early as September. Bevause this sub-alpine meadow ecosystem is so fragile, even one person crossing it can cause serious damage - especially if it is wet. By following the trail to your left on your hike to Pothole Dome, you can protect plants and animals during their active season.Illustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of both labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). Caption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. At the start of the Pothole Dome Trail, a brown sign outlined in white has white text that reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper.

Along sections of the Big Oak Flat and Wawona roads, automobiles were only permitted to go east, downgrade, on odd hours and west, upgrade, on even hours.

In 1906, Gabriel was placed in charge of Yosemite National Park, serving as the top park official for thirty years.

Many photographers enjoy gathering here to take pictures of Half Dome and its reflection in the Merced River, especially when the colors of sunset play on its rock face. The bridge is completely made of stone and is slightly arched. Wayside exhibits are affixed to the metal railing that is adhered to the rock barrier-walls on each side of the bridge. On the east side of the bridge, tall trees line the banks of the river and Half Dome rises over the tree line. The wayside exhibit is titled, The Story of Half Dome, and has a orange-toned, faint, background photo of textured granite rock. Text reads, millions of years ago the granite block of Half Dome was larger, but there never was a matching half. Undercut by glaciers near the base, slabs of rock fell away from a broad vertical crack in the granite, leaving a sheer face. Remnants of the missing rock still project from Half Dome's rim. There are more granite domes here than in any other place in the world. Massive granite domes from when large curved layers of rock \"exfoliate\" or slab off. Illustrated brochure: A side profile of Half Dome, with dark shadows in the front and low laying clouds floating below its face. In the background, some grey peaks cross the skyline and the sky is a bright orange and yellow. The text reads Yosemite Valley, on top, and Southern Pacific, on bottom.Caption: c. 1910Black and white postcard: Half Dome and trees surrounding it have an almost symmetrical reflection in the Merced River. Caption: Half Dome from Sentinel Bridge, postcard, c. 1940. Since the mid-19th century, countless images of the park's most famous dome, Half Dome, have been circulated. Its profile has become an enduring and instantly recognizable symbol of Yosemite. A section on the left side of the panel has a header that reads, An Ahwahneechee Tale of Half Dome. Text below it reads, long ago, two travelers, Tissiak and her husband, Tokoyee, fought with each other. He became so angry that he began to beat her; enraged, she hurled her basket of acorns at him. As they stood facing each other, they were turned to stone for their wickedness. The acorn basket (Basket Dome) lies upturned beside Tokoyee (North Dome) and the rock face of Tissiak (Half Dome) is stained with her tears. Photo: Half Dome is illuminated with the orange light of the alpen glow. Behind Half Dome, other mountains a lit as well, and the sky is full of dark clouds. Across the street, on the opposite side of the bridge, another wayside exhibit is affixed to the bridge barrier-wall. The wayside exhibit is titled, River of Mercy, and has a orange-toned, very faint, background photo of an old map of Yosemite Valley. Text reads, early Spanish explorers named the Merced River for Our Lady of Mercy. In Yosemite Valley, later settlers saw the Merced and its tributaries as troublesome as well as merciful. They channeled the wild river, dynamited the glacial moraine at the Valley entrance to lower the water table, and diverted water to quench the thirst of livestock and to power a sawmill. Black and white photo: The banks of a river have receded, and about three feet of roots of two tree stumps are exposed. The river flows nearby.Caption: Overuse damages the riverbanks and riparian life. Black and white photo: A woman in white, water-resistant pants with suspenders, a white t-shirt, boots, and a ponytail inserts a pole into the muddy ground on the banks of a river. Another woman with a t-shirt and gloves, bends down on her knees, and inserts a pole in the ground in the same spot. The river flows nearby. Caption: Volunteers assist park resource managers in revegetating riverbanks.Human alterations have harmed the riparian (river-related) habitat. Introduced fish species gradually outnumbered the native rainbow trout. Human feet have trampled the riverbanks and destroyed streamside plants. Restoration efforts such as replanting, fencing, and elimination of fish stocking are returning the river to a more natural state. A section on the left side of the panel has a header that reads, A Wild and Scenic River. Text below it reads, the Merced River watershed begins in the southeastern portion of the park, primarily in the high country of the Clark and Cathedral Ranges. The river plunges over Nevada and Vernal Falls, then meanders across the flat Yosemite Valley floor. Leaving Yosemite Valley, it winds down the Merced Canyon into the San Joaquin Valley far below. In 1987, recognizing the Merced's pristine beauty, Congress designated its upper reaches in and below the park as a National Wild and Scenic River.

The north side of the parking lot is lined with a wooden fence that separates the sidewalk from the large open meadow that shows views of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. Bus stop #11 stands at the southeast side of the parking lot. Four benches, a green recycle bin, brown trash bin, and a small, wood, shelter are all by the bus stop. Further south from the bus stop, a crosswalk leads across the street to the Sentinel Bridge. A few wayside exhibits are located in the parking lot, along the meadow. <br /><br />The first exhibit panel is titled Ecotones: Life on the Edge, and has a faint background photo of a small patch of meadow, containing long grasses and sedges, surrounded with pine trees. Panel text reads, the zone where two habitats merge is called an ecotone. The meadow/forest ecotone is visible here. The water-saturated meadow gives way to the oaks and towering conifers, which can't survive in flood-prone areas. The greatest diversity of wildlife exists in these transition areas where a variety of food and shelter is present. <br /><br />The Changing Landscape - By the 1860s, hotel owners were converting meadows to pastures, gardens, orchards, and hay fields. They suppressed fires because they threatened wooden buildings. They also channeled the Merced River to control flooding and drained boggy areas of the Valley. <br /><br />Black and white photo: Black and white spotted cows graze in an open meadow with towering cliffs surrounding them. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley, 1918.<br /><br />Meadows in Peril - Only a century ago the meadows of Yosemite Valley were far more extensive than they are today. With the right balance of water, fire, and soil conditions, a meadow can survive indefinitely. But with the altercation of the water table and fire cycle in the Valley, the natural balance was lost. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: An aerial view of a meadow below the iconic Half Dome shows larges patches of open meadows with trees scattered here and there. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley Meadows, 1899<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: An aerial view of a meadow below the iconic Half Dome shows dense stands of trees with only a few small patches of meadow showing.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley Meadows, 1991<br /><br />Next to the first wayside exhibit, a second one is titled Meltdown, and has a faint background photo of a waterfall coming over a tall, granite rockface. Panel text reads, the high-country snowpack is Yosemite's reservoir. As the snow melts in the spring, torrents of water cascade over Yosemite Falls (on the cliff before you) and over dozens of other waterfalls.<br /><br />Upstream, shallow soil on granite slopes absorbs very little water, Once the snow is gone, usually by late summer, most of Yosemite's waterfalls quickly dwindle. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: A close up view of a wet rock face. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Autumn<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: A thin stream of water falls over a large granite rock wall. White ice has built up on the rock face on both sides of the thin waterfall. At the bottom of the fall, a pile of snow has built up. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Winter<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 3: Two waterfalls are stacked on top of each other. The upper fall is full of water and the lower fall has a slightly more narrow, shorter, stream of water.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Spring<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 4: The two waterfalls that are stacked on top of each other have dwindled down to a think, hair-like strand of a waterfall.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Summer<br /><br />Quote: \"You should stop a while...a little below the head of the fall beside the enthusiastic throng of starry, comet-like waters to learn something of their strength, their marvelous variety of forms, and above all their glorious music, gathered and composed from the snow-storms, hail-, and rain- and wind-storms that have fallen on their glacier-sculptered, domey, ridgy basin.\" - John Muir, The Yosemite, \"How Best to Spend One's Yosemite Time\"<br /><br />Lost Arrow - Seasonal changes affect more than just the waterfalls. Water seeping into cracks and fissures in the cliff face freezes and expands in winter, wedging off blocks of stone. This action constantly reshapes Yosemite Valley.

The meadow has several trees that obstruct the open view. Small patches of grass grow mixed with small patches of bare, granitic sand. Granite rocks and boulders are randomly scattered. The wayside exhibit is titled, Meadow Dwellers, and has an illustration of a cross-section of a meadow on the top two-thirds of the panel. The illustration projects four layers of a meadow during the winter - an underground layer, a thin layer of air between the ground and the snow, a large layer of snow, and then what is above the snow. The left side of the illustration shows a large tree with its roots spreading out beneath the ground. Perched on one of the tree branches is a small, chipmunk-like animal, with a long, fuzzy, curled tail, labeled chickaree. To the bottom left of the tree is a small, mouse-like animal walking in the air pocket between the ground and snow layer; it is labeled a shrew. Below the ground, in the midst of the trees' roots is a grey squirrel, curled into a ball, sleeping in a pocket that has a tunnel leading to the grounds surface. It is labeled Belding Ground Squirrel. To the right of the tree are two large boulders that are half underground and half above ground. A tunnel leads underground into a pocket beneath a large boulder where an animal with a long, slender body rests on its haunches; it is labeled pocket gopher. A mouse nestles in an airpocket between the ground and snow, next to one of the large boulders. Above the snow layer, a coyote has his head tilted up with its mouth open, as if its howling, and a longtail weasel slithers down the snow. A mountain range is in the background.<br /><br />Caption: There is an air layer called the subnivean zone bewteen the snow and ground where small creatures live during the long winter. <br /><br />Panel text reads, when you look for wildlife here, think small.

In the east corner of the parking lot are two large brown trash dumpsters, and one large green dumpster for recycling. The wayside exhibit panel is blue and is bolted to a frame made of thick wooden posts, and is titled, welcome to Tenaya Lake. Half of the panel background is a two-toned picture of a lake that is surrounded by domes and peaks. The other half of the panel is a map. The caption reads, caught between immense granite domes and the clear High Sierra sky, Tenaya Lake is the largest lake in Yosemite National Park. Here, at its eastern end, Tenaya Creek forms a series of braided streams before flowing into the lake. Text reads, if you have a few hours, stroll the flat, paved trail (less than a quarter-mile, round-trip). You'll be rewarded with glimpses of the glacially carved peaks and domes and a spectacular view of the lake emerging through the trees. If time permits, take a picnic to one of the tables on the beach and enjoy a lazy High Sierra afternoon exploring or relaxing in the smooth granitic sand. While hardy souls may be tempted to jump in, remember...Tenaya Lake is fed by snowmelt and stays quite cold!If you have half a day, don't miss the boardwalk, a picnic, or the beach, but (if conditions permit) cross the Tenaya Creek inlet at the southeast end of the beach and follow the trail west along the shore of the lake. This mostly-level stroll takes you toward the Sunrise Lakes Trailhead, joining back with the Tioga Road. Here, you can retrace your steps back or hop on the free shuttle at Stop #10, and ride one stop back to your car (stop #9). It is possible to walk all the way around the lake (2.8 mi/5.2 km), but requires walking along the shoulder of busy Tioga Road. A full-day hike to Tuolumne Meadows - Pick up a trail heading east from Tenaya Lake. This 9-mile one-way hike parallels the Tioga Road, leading to Tuolumne Meadows. At Tuolumne Meadows, pick up the free shuttle for the short ride back to Tenaya Lake. Shuttle Information - The free Tioga Road shuttle runs between Tuolumne Meadows and Olmsted Point. Shuttle schedule changes seasonally and as conditions permit. Check local postings for current schedule. During times of high water, unbridged river or creek crossings can be hazardous. Take extra time and use good judgement when crossing rivers and creeks. Check the weather! Be especially aware of the potential for thunderstorms. If you are hiking, take a map and compass. Tell someone where you are going and when you'll be back. Avoid exhaustion and dehydration. Carry plenty of water and high-energy snacks. The altitude at Tenaya Lake is just over 8,000 feet above sea level. Signs of altitude sickness can include nausea, dizziness, and headache. Descending to a lower elevation can help alleviate symptoms. Scrambling or climbing on rocks can be dangerous. Remember, coming down can be much harder than going up, and wet rocks are slippery. Be prepared to pack out what you pack in; garbage and recycling receptacles are located near the parking area. Map: The map shows Tenaya Lake, indicated by a large, blue, oval shape, slightly tilted, in the center of the map. A white line extends diagonally across the map, from the bottom left to the top right, passing by the north shore of Tenaya Lake. A trail, indicated by red dotted lines, passes by the south shore of the Tenaya Lake and partly follows a few creeks, indicated by a blue solid line, before splitting off into different trails to the left and right. To the left of the lake, icons indicate the start of hiking trails, restrooms, and parking. To the right of the lake, a red dot indicates you are here, and icons indicating trailheads, parking, restrooms, and picnic areas are shown. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. A flat dirt path leads into the forest with several wayside exhibits along the way to the Tenaya Lake shoreline. The first wayside exhibit is titled, disappearing wetlands. Text reads, wetlands like this one have likely been here for the last 10,000 years, providing homes and food for a great variety of plant and animal species. In Yosemite, wetland areas make up only about 3% of the landscape, but are estimated to harbor up to one-third of all the plant species in the Park. They also capture, store, and release melting snow, extending the availability of life-giving water during the dry summer months. Here in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and across the globe, wetlands are disappearing rapidly. Effects from trampling, development, and climate change threaten to alter the delicate wetland ecology forever. In Yosemite National Park, park managers work to prevent loss of wetlands by preserving and restoring wetland areas and building boardwalks to help minimize damage from visitors.

The area is surrounded by different pine and fir trees and has an open view looking westward.\\n\\nThe first wayside exhibit is titled, Cones and Needles. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, Because of its wide range of elevations, Yosemite encompasses several life zones determined by elevation, moisture, temperature, and exposure to storms. Sometimes, conditions vary significantly within a zone and allow for a micro-climate, a place where the climate contrasts with that of the entire zone. You are in one such micro-climate. Around you, trees that typically grow at higher or lower elevations live in close proximity. Stroll around this area and discover stories of four common Yosemite trees, their relationships with wildlife, and struggles to survive. \\n\\nIllustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of the first two labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). \\n\\nCaption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. \\n\\nText on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, cache crop - ever forget where you left your keys? Chipmunks, ground squirrels, and many birds have the same problem. They bury small caches of seeds here and there, and then forget where they put many of these food caches. Consequently, forgetful birds and animals planted many of the trees nearby. \\n\\nA series of four photos show different types of trees. \\n\\nPhoto one is a Red Fir forest, shown with their long branches drooping from the weight of snow that covers them. The trees are tall with pointed tips and reddish bark. \\n\\nPhoto two is a single Lodgepole Pine, which has a conical shape that tapers, and grey bark. \\n\\nPhoto three is a single Jeffrey Pine, which has several large branches shooting off a rather bare trunk. Smaller secondary pine branches shoot off the large primary branches. There is no conical shape to this tree, it is randomly fanned out in all directions. \\n\\nPhoto four is a single Western White Pine, which is a tall, very narrow, slender conical shape, with branches that are arranged in neatly layered horizontal tiers.\\n\\nThe second wayside exhibit is titled, Red Fir, abies magnifica, and has a close-up photo of Red Fir bark on the entire left, one-fifth side of the panel. The bark is reddis-brown and has deep striations. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, the red fir is a spectacular tree, impressive for its height and girth. It can sometimes rise above 200 feet tall, and be nearly 10 feet in diameter. The bark of mature trees is deeply furrowed with a distinctive reddish hue. \\n\\nIllustration: A brown pine branch shows green needles that are rounded off at the ends, growing directly out of the branch. A rounded pine cone, which has layers upon layers that closely overlap each other, appears to be closed and smooth. Cone size is 9 inches (23 cm).\\n\\nCaption: Tree ID hint - How can you tell a fir from a pine? Think \"F\" for friendly fir. The needles of a fir are soft, and they grow from the branch instead of in bunches. \\n\\nWhen Lightning Strikes - Lightning often hits the tallest of these red firs, leaving snag-topped crowns. These damaged areas provide fertile foraging areas for woodpeckers and sapsuckers looking for grubs. The snags also provide homes for nesting owls and squirrels. \\n\\nIllustration: A speckled owl with horn-like pointy ears sits on a snaggled tree trunk that seems to have snapped apart.\\n\\nThe third wayside exhibit is titled, Western White Pine, pinus monticola, and has a close-up photo of Western White Pine bark on the entire left, one-fifth side of the panel. The bark is brown and looks like square plates or bricks that are stacked vertically. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, look beyond the red fir log in front of you. The tree with square-like plates on its bark is the Western White Pine. Their trunks are usually straight, and typically their branches are arranged in neatly layered horizontal tiers. They cannot tolerate deep shade and generally grow in open spaces where they can soak up the rays of the sun.

There are also two wayside exhibits and three portable restrooms, one of which is designated accessible. \\n\\nOn the west side of the driveway, an open meadow that has large boulders scattered about, transitions into a dense pine forest. A wayside exhibit titled, Disappearing Meadow, sits at the edge of the meadow and paved driveway. Text on the left side of the panel reads, as recently as the 1960s, this area was an open wet meadow that dominated the foreground in this view of the Cathedral Range Mountains. However, the meadows are beginning to dry up, providing better conditions for trees to grow. Current science is documenting the increase in Earth's temperature which is advantageous for trees due to longer, warmer growing seasons. While scientists are still investigating other possible reasons for the changes you see, climate change is likely a primary factor. \\n\\nPhoto: An open meadow has small saplings growing throughout it. In the distance, mountain peaks rise above a line of mature, tall trees. \\n\\nCaption: 1963 view of Cathedral Range from this meadow. \\n\\nPhoto: A small grassy area has a dense stand of pine trees.\\n\\nCaption: In 2009, young trees dominate the same view. \\n\\nBlack and white photo: a man, dressed in a long sleeved shirt, long pants, and cap, stands among hundreds of sheep bunched together in a meadow, with tall trees surrounding the open pasture.\\n\\nCaption: In the late 1800s, cattle ranchers and sheep herders drove their herds into these lush grassy meadows to graze. Human occupation and use increased to accommodate the silver mines established in the Tioga area during the 1870s. These human impacts to vegetation and hydrology may accentuate the effects of climate change. \\n\\nOn the east side of the driveway, a stream snakes through an open meadow that also transitions into a dense forest. A reddish peak rises on the left while a grey, granite peak rises to the right. A wooden sign by the stream reads, domestic water supply - do not contaminate. A wayside exhibit is also stationed here titled, The Core of Volcanoes. Text on the left side of the panel reads, rising before you are two of the highest peaks in Yosemite, Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs. Their reddish-brown color hints at a different origin than the white granites of the other mountains in the park. The metamorphic rocks forming the summit areas of Mounts Dana and Gibbs are the exposed core of an ancient volcanic mountain range that once graced the Pacific coast. Once miles beneath tall volcanoes, they were slowly revealed as erosion stripped away the overlying rocks. \\n\\nPhoto: Two peaks rise above a treeline. The silhouette of the two mountain peaks that are labeled Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, is outlined with a red dotted line.\\n\\nIllustration: The cross-section illustration of the inner and outer workings of a volcano are shown, below and above ground. In the ground, a layer of reddish-orange, oval-like chambers of magma lay horizontally, overlapping and connecting to each other. Thick vein-like paths of magma extend upward through a layer of earth, connecting with the layer of oval chambers above. A small portion of the upper part of the reddish-orange oval chambers is white and is labeled Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, and is noted as crystallizing granite. Above the chambers is a brown area, labeled as metamorphic rock, that slopes up into a peak. A red, thin, vein-like line leads from the magma chambers to the peak and exits as a plume of smoke.

Text on the left side of the panel reads, you are now near the alpine zone, which includes the highest elevations in Yosemite. Look a few hundred feet higher, and you can see that trees cannot grow because the rugged terrain is windy, dry, and intensely sunlit. To survive such harsh conditions, plants here lie flat against the ground or crouch between stones. Special pigments in their leaves filter out harmful rays of sunlight. Some plants grow in little pincushion-like bunches. If they stand too tall the wind will dry them out or tear them apart. Their vibrant blossoms burst forth in an extra effort to attract insects. \\n\\nIllustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the far right of the road is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). \\n\\nCaption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. \\n\\nTwo photos show two different kinds of wild flowers. The first wildflower is called Davidson's penstemon and is light purple. They are growing in a bunch, out of a crack in a granite rock and are short in stature. Their small flowers are a bit long and flute-like, curving outward at the ends. The second photo shows a wildflower called Sky Pilot, which is purple, and has a spherical bulb of multiple flowers that shoot out of an erect stem. They are growing in a bunch in a rocky area. \\n\\nText on the right side of the panel reads, pikas need to get out of the sun periodically to cool down or they risk lethal overheating. These small mammals live in rock piles at high elevations. They gather plants for winter food in nearby areas, frequently returning to the shade of the rocks. As Earth's temperature warms, they will have to spend more time in the rock piles cooling down. If they have to spend too much time cooling down, they won't be able to harvest enough food to survive the winter. \\n\\nPhoto: In the bottom right corner, a small, greyish-brown, furry pika faces left and is leaning forward on a rock.

The map shows a red dot toward the middle of the map, which is labeled, you are here. A yellow squiggle line, representing the trail, makes its way through a faint canopy of trees upward from the red dot to the sequoia grove. A trail also travels downward from the red dot, leading nowhere specific, and eventually fades out. An aerial view of about 8 bold tree tops are shown at the end of the trail, as well as a tree trunk that has a tunnel through it. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A sequoia tree trunk, with the upper half of the tree gone, has a tunnel carved out of it. <br /><br />Caption: The temptation when visiting the Tuolumne Grove is to turn your eyes to the sky line, accessing the superlative qualities of these massive giants. Take a moment along your trip to reflect on the things that can go by unnoticed - the deep silence that accompanies each snow-muffled winter, the moment each spring when the tiny winter wren begins building her nest, the emergence of the white Pacific dogwood petals. <br /><br />Think also of moments in this grove's recent human history, the jangle of bridles from the first pioneers, pilgrims and discoverers who passed this way, or the rumble of the first automobile engine after the new road was cut. The passage of time through the Tuolumne Grove is marked in small ways, with your experience here being just the most recent. <br /><br />Map: A generalized map of the entire park, labeled Yosemite National Park, shows the three areas to find sequoia groves in the park. They are indicated by a sequoia tree icon. The Tuolumne Grove and Merced Grove are side by side and located on the left side of the map, about half-way down from the top. The Mariposa Grove is located at the bottom tip of the map. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the panel reads, one of the three giant sequoia grove in Yosemite National Park, the Tuolumne Grove contains about 25 mature trees. While enjoying your walk through the grove, consider the rarity of this experience. These few maturing giant sequoias appear large and strong but are facing an unknown future. Climate change-and the resulting changes in hydrology and fire regime-may have an effect on the future of giant sequoias. Avoid walking in areas immediately surrounding the trees.

It is a small, brown, wooden building with a front porch and wood railing. Steps or a ramp access the front porch from the left. Two unisex restrooms are also located on the left side of the building. Along the outside wall, beneath the porch roof, is a trip planning flip book, a map of the Tuolumne vicinity, a few flyers, and a line of five exhibit signs. The panels are secured inside wood framing. At the top of the frame is a wooden sign that reads, you determine the quality of Yosemite Wilderness - Please leave no trace! <br /><br />The first panel of the five is green and beige and is titled, campsite selection. Panel text reads, choose an existing campsite at least 100 feet (80 steps) from water and trail. <br />Use a large container to carry water to your campsite.<br />Arrange your camp so that trees, shrubs, and rocks hide it from view.<br />Please do not build additions such as fire rings, walls, and benches.<br />When you leave, make sure your campsite is clean.<br /><br />Why? Using an existing and appropriately placed camp on durable ground improves wilderness quality. Camping away from lakes and streams is warmer, has fewer insects, and allows wildlife access to water. Using a water container will reduce the number of trips to lakes and streams. This prevents the formation or expansion of trails, protects plants near water sources, and preserves water quality. The spread of campsite impacts affects everyone's enjoyment of the wilderness. <br /><br />Illustration: A plastic water jug with a spigot. <br /><br />The second panel of the five is maroon and beige and is titled, water quality. Panel text reads, Use a trowel to help keep water clean! Bury all human waste in a 6 inch deep \"cat hole\" 80 steps (100 feet) from water or camps. Pack out all toilet paper. Do all washing at least 80 steps from water, too. Filter or treat all drinking water.<br /><br />Why? Appropriate disposal of human waste and proper washing of your dishes or yourself are the keys to the quality of wilderness water. Unburied human waste and toilet paper around a campsite, and soapsuds and food scraps in our lakes and streams, are unhealthy and show little respect for other wilderness users. Remember; even biodegradable soap pollutes the water and can injure fish and other aquatic life. The disease giardiasis is usually traced to drinking water that contains impurities from human waste that is not properly buried. <br /><br />Illustration: A water pump and a trowel are shown.<br /><br />The third panel of the five is blue and beige and is titled, camp fires. Panel text reads, campfires are allowed below 9600 feet in elevation. Use only an established fire ring located at least 100 feet from water. Keep fires small. Use only dead and down wood that is on the ground and is smaller than your wrist. Never leave fires unattended. Make sure they are out before you leave. Pick up any litter in the area in or around the fire ring. The use of gas stoves is quick, clean, and encouraged to reduce the impacts of campfires. <br /><br />Why? Fallen trees and branches provide habitat and shelter for other plants and wildlife and add essential nutrients to the soil. Vegetation grows very slowly at high elevations, so fires are allowed only below the alpine zone (9600 feet); Using existing fire rings prevents the spread of fire-blackened rocks and charcoal, which already scar many campsites. Never build a new fire ring or build a fire against a boulder. <br /><br />Illustration: a small, red, gas canister is attached to a small metal cooking stobe by a thin tube.<br /><br />The fourth panel of the five is maroon and beige and is titled, food storage. Panel text reads, don't let bears or other animals eat your food. Properly store all food, garbage, and anything with an odor in camp and at trailheads. Use bear-resistant food storage canisters and keep a clean camp.<br /><br />Why? Some animals, particularly bears, become dependent on human food. When this happens, the animal is usually the loser - sometimes with its life. Unnatural food sources promote changes in foraging habits and population dynamics. Socialized animals can transmit diseases, upset normal ecological behavior, and become a danger to people. Do your part to keep the \"wild\" in wildlife by properly storing everything with an odor, not discarding food scraps, and packing out all garbage. <br /><br />The fifth panel of the five is green and beige and is titled, trails. Panel text reads, stay on the trail. Don't cut switchbacks or take shortcuts! Leave dogs and bicycles at home - they are prohibited on trails and in wilderness areas. Give right-of-way to stock (horses, mules, or llamas). Stand quietly on the side of the trail while they pass. <br /><br />Why? Help maintain the trail system! shortcutting and cutting switchbacks cause erosion, trail destruction, and falling rocks. Not only does it take more energy on your part, but the damage it can cause is costly and may be impossible to restore. Improper behavior around stock may hurt you, the rider, or the animal itself. Dogs are not allowed on trails because pets can transmit diseases and harass wildlife. Trails are designated for hikers and stock users only. Keep bicycles and baby strollers on roads or desginated bike paths. <br /><br />Illustration: a map that is turned diagonally, creating a diamond shape. <br /><br />A brown trash dumpster, a green recycle dumpster, and over eleven food storage lockers neatly line the west end of the parking lot. <br /><br />", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "a125666a-8248-4e52-bf86-362ba88c577d", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Bear Canister Purchase/Rental", "Information - Ranger/Staff Member Present", "Permits Issued", "Picnic Table", "Recycling", "Restroom", "Trash/Litter Receptacles", "Water - Drinking/Potable", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Panel text reads, James McCauley, an Irish immigrant and proprietor of the Glacier Point Hotel, hired John Conway to survey and construct a trail from Yosemite Valley to Glacier Point. Taking only seven months to build, it was completed in the early summer of 1872. The original trail was four miles long and travelers paid a $1 toll. In the 1920s, the National Park Service lengthened the trail to improve the steeper sections. Today it is 4.6 miles from the Valley to Glacier Point. <br /><br />Black and white photo: One of Yosemite Valley's high, 2,000-foot plus rock walls has a noticeable trail zigzagging its way to the top. <br /><br />Caption: \"...it is the steepest trail out of the valley, zigzagging back and forth a sheer granite wall, one rides up it with little alarm or giddiness.\" - Helen Hunt Jackson, from Ah-Wah-Ne Days: A visit to Yosemite Valley in 1872.

Text in the white section reads, Mirror Lake is not really a lake at all. Until the middle of the 20th century, park personnel dredged sand to maintain a pond that reflected the cliffs above. Current park policy is to let the natural succession of pond to meadow occur. During high water, however, you can still see a stunning reflection of Half Dome. <br /><br />Photo: One person stands in ankle-deep snow, with a backpack on the ground by his side, and his back turned from the camera. He is facing a small body of water and the large face of Half Dome which towers over this lake. Snow covers the landscape. <br /><br />Caption: At Half Dome's base, Mirror Lake forms in winter and spring, but is more of a sandy beach during the dry season. NPS photo by Erik Skindrud.<br /><br />The third panel is white with an orange bar across the top. Text in the orange bar reads, Be Bear Aware. Text in the white box reads, Keeping bears away from your food isn't just a way to avoid a fine-it could save a bear's life. Do not store food in vehicles after dark. When not stored in a locker or cabin, food must be within arm's length. Stay at least 50 yards from a bear. If a bear approaches, yell to scare it away. <br /><br />Photo: A reddish-brown black bear with yellow plastic tags on both ears, is hanging halfway out of a parked car's side door window. The door frame is bent half way down, the side view mirror is dangling, and the glass has been busted out.

Also, the accessible trail to Lower Yosemite Fall begins north of the shuttle stop. Limited roadside parking is located east of shuttle stop six. Near the bus stop shelter is a large map of trails. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. The map header reads Welcome to Yosemite Falls. On the side of the large map is a smaller header that reads: About Yosemite Falls A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Heights of the Falls<br />The text reads: Upper Fall, 1,430 feet, 435 meters, Middle Cascades, 675 feet, 205 meters, 320 feet, 98 meters, 2,425 feet, 740 meters. <br /><br />Photo, located to the left of the above text, shows an aerial sepia-toned photo of Yosemite Falls, and labels each part of the Falls, Upper Fall, Middle Cascades, and Lower Fall. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: World Ranking<br />The text reads: Yosemite Falls is the tallest waterfall in the United States, and the 5th tallest waterfall in the world. The tallest is Salto Angel in Venezuela at 3,212 feet, 979 meters.<br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Source of the Falls<br />The text reads: Yosemite Creek, which flows over this waterfall, is entirely fed by melting snow. It drains an area of nearly 50 square miles. At its peak volume in late spring, 2,400 gallons per second, or 9,000 liters, flow over the lip of the Upper Fall. Every summer, when the snow from this drainage is entirely melted, Yosemite Falls usually run dry. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Ice Cone<br />The text reads: In winter, a dramatic cone of ice accumulates at the base of the Upper Fall. The maximum height of the cone is documented at 322 feet, about as tall as a 25 story building. When temperatures warm up in early spring, the water from the fall begins to drill a hole at the top of the cone, creating a volcano-like structure, and by mid-April, most of the cone has melted. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Moonbow<br />The text reads: The full moon in April and May offers a special treat at the base of Lower Yosemite Fall. As the moon rises, the light is captured and refracted in the massive spray of the fall, creating a phenomenon called a moonbow. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Frazil Ice<br />The text reads: In early spring, frazil ice sometimes forms in waterfalls and creeks when water becomes super cooled by turbulence. Ice crystals form and group into spongy masses which sometimes overflow the creek bed. In 1997 frazil ice was above the railings of the Lower Yosemite Fall bridge, almost completely burying it!<br /><br />Quote: When the afternoon sunshine is streaming through the throng of comets, ever wasting, ever renewed, the marvelous fineness, firmness and variety of their forms are beautifully revealed. - John Muir<br />", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Bus/Shuttle Stop", "Trash/Litter Receptacles", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

We have lived on the land as hunters and gatherers, and traditional skills and beliefs were passed on. We still live here and continue to teach our children the ways of our ancestors. The lower panel is titled, Archeological Site Protection, and has a faint, sepia-toned background photo of three Native American children grouped together. A young girl in a plaid dress and hat is on the left. A young boy with a white, long-sleeved shirt, hat, and long bangs, is to the right of the young girl, and is slightly taller than she is. An older girl, in a white, long-sleeved blouse and long skirt, sits on the ground to the right of the two others, and smiles at the camera.

Help protect the wilderness, and avoid a citation, by following these regulations.Camp at least four trail miles from all developed areas. Pets, firearms, and bicycles are prohibited in wilderness. Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks kills vegetation and causes erosion. Maximum group size for cross-country travel is eight people.Avoid disturbing wildlife and other visitors by keeping quiet on the trail and in camp. Use a gas stove for cooking; wood fires are allowed only below 9,600 feet in existing fire rings using dead and downed wood. Leave campsites as you find them; do not build windbreaks, fire rings, hitch racks, chairs, drainage trenches, or other \"improvements.\"Pack out everything you carry in; do not burn trash. Wilderness permit required for all overnight use. A series of three white circles containing three different icons are outlined in red and have a red diagonal line slashing through the middle. The three icons are of a gun, a dog, and a person on a bicycle.The bottom left panel is yellow with black text and reads, Black Bears - the health and well-being of Yosemite's bears depends on you. Bears are intelligent, curious, adaptable, and hungry. Human food, however, is harmful to bears and other animals here. Keep wildlife wild by using these food storage methods.At the trailhead: Remove all food, ice chests, and scented items from you car. Store them in food storage lockers where available. Never feed bears or other wildlife. In the backcountry: Store food, garbage, and scented items in bearproof canisters, available at front country locations. Keep items stored whenever you are not eating. Remember, bears are active day and night. Scare away any bears you see by making loud noises and acting aggressively. Report all bear incidents.The bottom right panel is blue with white text and reads, water quality - clean, sparkling water is one of the joys of the high country. Wildlife, wilderness visitors, and people downstream all need clean water to stay healthy. Protect your water suppy by following these regulations and suggestions:Camp at least 100 feet (40 steps) from water.Deposit human waste in a six-inch-deep hole at least 100 feet from water; carry out toilet paper.Wash dishes and yourself at least 100 feet from water; even biodegradeable soap pollutes.Carry a large water container and limit your trips to collect water; eroded stream banks and lakeshores contribute to poor water quality.

There is a wooden divider stretching across the inside of the bridge, making a path for people to walk on, and a road for the stagecoach to use. An exhibit sign reads: The Covered Bridge. The deck and truss portion of this bridge across the South Fork of the Merced River was built around 1857 by settler Galen Clark, who established a tourist facility there. The area was then called Clark's Station. The road from Wawona to the Yosemite Valley opened in 1875 just after the Washburn brothers purchased Clark's holdings. The brothers, who were from Vermont, covered the bridge soon thereafter. Bridges were covered primarily to protect the large wood truss beams and flooring from the weather. It is much easier to re-shingle a roof than to replace the major supporting structures. Although the large beams were hand-hewn with ax and adze, the lumber to cover the bridge was cut locally at the Washburn's sawmill. Did the Washburn brothers cover the bridge exclusively for practical reasons? Maybe so. But a granddaughter claims the reason was nostalgia - they were homesick for a bit of New England.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": [], "relevanceScore": 1.0}}

Carved by tributary glaciers about 20,000 years ago, the V-shaped Yosemite Creek drainage was enlarged by the heavy volume of water and `ice which rushed through as the glacier retreated. Today, as spring snow melts, an average of 2,400 gallons per second of icy runoff is funneled through this hanging valley before plunging over the vertical cliff 2,425 feet to Yosemite Valley below. <br /><br />Photo: A river with white water flows toward a precipice.

The trial continues to parallel Yosemite Creek for another 3.3 miles below. Follow the signs to the overlook at Yosemite Point, a short distance to the east, for a glimpse of the breathtaking drop into Yosemite Valley and across the High Sierra. Use caution, wet rocks can be slippery. <br /><br />Map: A tall, rectangular map of the surrounding area, shows a horizontal, squiggly, grey line near the top of the map, crossing from left to right, and is labeled Tioga Road. Along the Tioga Road, about three-quarters of the way to the right, a red dot indicates, \"you are here.\" A dotted diagonal line extends downard and slightly to the left from the red dot, representing the Yosemite Creek Trail. Along the trail, Yosemite Creek Campground and the top of Yosemite Falls are labeled. At the bottom of the dotted line is Yosemite Valley. Upper Yosemite Fall and Lower Yosemite Fall are represented by a series of three blue lines stacked on top of one another, each line shorter than the one above it.

The lower fall is half the height of the upper fall.<br /><br />Caption: V-shaped Yosemite Creek watershed and Yosemite Falls.<br /><br />A map labeled, The Tioga Road, is on a sign board inside a wooden frame. The map shows the entire park with emphasis only on the Tioga Road, which is a red, solid, squiggly line that crosses the map from left to right, midway down the map. Major areas, beginning from the left include Crane Flat, which has icons indicating restrooms, groceries, gas, campground, and two sequioa groves that are in the area. A bit to the right is Tamarack Flat Campground. A quarter of the way across the map is White Wolf, which has icons indicating a campground, dining, and hiking are in that area.

Halfway across the map are Olmsted Point, which has no services, and Tenaya Lake, which has multiple hiking, picnic, and restroom icons in the area. About two-thirds of the way across the map is Tuolumne Meadows, which has icons indicating camping, dining, restrooms, groceries, a wilderness center, and hiking, which includes Cathedral Lakes and Lembert Dome. Near the right side of the map, past Tuolumne Meadows, Mono Pass, a hiking destination, and Tioga Pass, the east entrance and exit to the park, are found along Tioga Road.

To the right of the entrance is a large slab of a giant sequoia trunk, about 9 feet in diameter. A sign reads Big Tree, sequoiadendron giganteum. This nine foot section of a giant sequoia was cut 30 feet from the base of a tree that fell in the Mariposa Grove in 1919. Annual rings show the tree's to be 996 years old, but at the base of the tree, where the diameter was 14 feet, the age was found to be 1,100 years. One of the largest trees in the Mariposa Grove, the Grizzly Giant, has been estimated to be 1790 years old. These big trees should not be confused with the coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens, which is utilized commercially. Both are sequoias, part of the redwood family of trees, but the giant sequoia Sequoia giganteum, is native only to the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. The coast redwood grows along the Pacific coast from the Monterey Peninsula to southwestern Oregon. The fossil record indicates that over forty species of the redwood family once existed in the Northern Hemisphere. Eighteen species survive to the present, three of which have the name sequoia. There are nine small green arrows tags pointing at rings in the tree, progressing from the oldest, inner ring to the outer, most recent ring.
